== Overview

This document identifies assumptions in the plugin architecture that **require empirical verification** before implementation. These are not design decisions but **unknowns about Claude Code/Claude.ai capabilities** that could affect architectural feasibility.

== Status Legend

* ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Could break core architecture if assumption is wrong
* 🔍 **IMPORTANT** - Affects implementation approach
* 💡 **OPTIMIZATION** - Affects performance or user experience

'''

== CRITICAL Research Topics

=== 1. Skills Access from Claude.ai Web ⚠️

==== Current Assumption

**Documented in**: `architecture-overview.adoc:122-170` (Skills Access Mechanism)

**Assumption**: Claude.ai web can automatically fetch skills from public GitHub repositories via URL.

**What the spec claims**:
[source]
----
Agent prompt: "Read cui-java-standards skill from https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules"
→ Claude fetches: https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/skills/cui-java-standards/SKILL.md
→ Skill references: ./standards/java/java-code-standards.adoc
→ Claude fetches: https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/standards/java/java-code-standards.adoc
----

==== Why This Matters

**Impact**: If this doesn't work, the **entire cross-platform strategy fails**.

* Claude.ai web users cannot install plugins
* Skills must be accessible somehow or architecture needs redesign
* Affects 50% of expected users (web vs CLI)

**Architectural dependencies**:
* Agents can be synchronized to `.claude/` (git-controlled)
* But skills are never synchronized (to avoid drift)
* Therefore, skills MUST be accessible dynamically or entire approach breaks

==== What Needs Testing

**Test Environment**: Claude.ai web interface (NOT Claude Code)

**Test Scenario 1: Direct URL in Agent Prompt**
[source,markdown]
----
# In .claude/agents/test-agent.md
System prompt:
"Read the skill file from this URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/main/skills/cui-java-standards/SKILL.md

Then follow the instructions in that skill."
----

**Expected Behavior**:
* ✅ Claude can access the URL
* ✅ Claude reads the SKILL.md content
* ✅ Claude can then follow references to standards files

**Test Scenario 2: Skill Reference by Name**
[source,markdown]
----
# In .claude/agents/test-agent.md
System prompt:
"Read the cui-java-standards skill from the cuioss/cui-llm-rules repository."
----

**Expected Behavior**:
* ✅ Claude resolves skill name to repository URL
* ✅ Claude fetches skill content

**Test Scenario 3: Relative Path Resolution**
[source,markdown]
----
# After Claude reads SKILL.md which contains:
"Read standards from: ./standards/java/java-code-standards.adoc"
----

**Expected Behavior**:
* ✅ Claude resolves relative path against repository root
* ✅ Claude fetches: https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/standards/java/java-code-standards.adoc

==== Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Test Scenario 1 succeeds (direct URL fetch)
* [ ] Test Scenario 3 succeeds (relative path resolution after fetch)
* [ ] Test Scenario 2 is optional (nice-to-have skill name resolution)

==== Alternative Approaches if Assumption Fails

**Option A: Embed Essential Content in Agents**
* Pros: Self-contained, no external dependencies
* Cons: Drift risk (defeats purpose of skills layer), large agent files

**Option B: Skills in Project .claude/**
* Synchronize skills to `.claude/skills/` (currently not in spec)
* Pros: Available to all platforms
* Cons: Drift risk, violates "never synchronize skills" principle

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
* Essential Rules embedded (already in spec)
* Skills provide "nice to have" additional context
* Pros: Degrades gracefully
* Cons: Reduces value of skills layer

==== Verification Steps

. Create test repository with sample skill
. Create test agent that references skill by URL
. Deploy to project `.claude/agents/`
. Test in Claude.ai web interface
. Document actual behavior
. Update architecture if needed

'''

== IMPORTANT Research Topics

=== 2. Plugin Update Mechanism 🔍

==== Current Assumption

**Documented in**: `plugin-structure.adoc:663-689` (Known Limitations)

**Assumption**: No individual plugin update command exists; updates via `/plugin marketplace update marketplace-name`

==== What Needs Testing

**Test Scenario**:
[source,bash]
----
# Does this command exist?
/plugin update cui-standards

# Or only this?
/plugin marketplace update cui-llm-rules
----

**Questions**:
* Is there a hidden `/plugin update` command?
* Does marketplace update automatically update installed plugins?
* Can users pin to specific versions?

==== Why This Matters

Affects update workflow documentation and user experience.

==== Verification Steps

. Install plugin
. Check `/plugin --help` for all available commands
. Update plugin version in marketplace
. Test update mechanisms
. Document actual behavior

'''

=== 3. Semantic Version Pinning 🔍

==== Current Assumption

**Documented in**: `plugin-structure.adoc:569-574`

**Assumption**: Cannot pin to specific plugin version (e.g., `cui-standards@1.2.0`)

==== What Needs Testing

**Test Scenario**:
[source,bash]
----
# Does this work?
/plugin install cui-standards@1.0.0

# Or does it always install latest?
/plugin install cui-standards@cui-llm-rules
----

==== Why This Matters

* Affects version management strategy
* Impacts team consistency (can teams enforce same version?)
* Affects rollback capability

==== Verification Steps

. Create plugin with v1.0.0
. Tag and release v1.1.0
. Try installing v1.0.0 specifically
. Document whether version pinning is supported

'''

=== 4. Skills Loading at Runtime 🔍

==== Current Assumption

**Documented in**: `architecture-overview.adoc:196-210` (Progressive Disclosure Model)

**Assumption**: Skills use "progressive disclosure" - metadata loaded at startup, full content via Read tool when needed.

==== What Needs Testing

**Questions**:
* When exactly does Claude load skill content?
* Does "Read tool" mean Claude's Read tool or just reading the file?
* Can skills use Read tool to fetch standards, or is this one fetch operation?

**Test Scenario**:
[source,yaml]
----
# skills/test-skill/SKILL.md with frontmatter:
---
name: Test Skill
description: Test skill loading
allowed-tools: Read
---

This skill references: ./standards/test.adoc
----

**Questions to answer**:
* When is SKILL.md content loaded?
* Can the skill use Read tool from within its context?
* How are relative paths resolved?

==== Why This Matters

Affects skill design patterns and performance characteristics.

'''

=== 5. Private Repository Access 🔍

==== Current Assumption

**Documented in**: `architecture-overview.adoc:152-155`

**Assumption**: Private repositories require "explicit configuration" but mechanism unspecified.

==== What Needs Testing

**For Private Repositories**:
* Can Claude.ai web access private GitHub repos if user is authenticated?
* Is there a `.claude/settings.json` field for repository credentials?
* Does it require repository to be cloned locally?

**Test Scenarios**:
. Make cui-llm-rules private
. Test if Claude.ai can still access it
. Document authentication mechanism (if any)

==== Why This Matters

* Many organizations use private repositories
* Affects adoption for enterprise users
* May require different distribution strategy

'''

== OPTIMIZATION Research Topics

=== 6. Skills Read Tool Restrictions 💡

==== Current Assumption

**Documented in**: `component-specifications.adoc:428-442`

**Assumption**: Skills should restrict tools to Read-only via `allowed-tools: Read`

==== What Needs Testing

**Questions**:
* What happens if skill has no `allowed-tools` restriction?
* Can skills execute arbitrary code if unrestricted?
* Is `allowed-tools` enforced or just advisory?

==== Why This Matters

Security and isolation of skills layer.

'''

=== 7. Essential Rules Drift Detection Automation 💡

==== Current Assumption

**Documented in**: `component-specifications.adoc:302-344`

**Assumption**: `/agents-doctor sync` requires manual approval for updates.

==== What Needs Testing

**Questions**:
* Could this be fully automated with user opt-in?
* Should there be a "safe mode" for non-breaking updates?
* Can we detect semantic vs. trivial changes?

==== Why This Matters

Reduces maintenance burden if automation is possible.

'''

== PLUGIN MANIFEST Research Topics

=== 8. plugin.json Field Support 🔍

==== What Needs Testing

**Documented field support**:
[source,json]
----
{
  "claudeCode": {
    "minVersion": "0.1.0"  // Is this enforced?
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "plugins": [],         // Does this work?
    "mcpServers": []       // Does this work?
  }
}
----

**Questions**:
* Is `minVersion` enforced by Claude Code?
* Can plugins declare dependencies on other plugins?
* Can plugins require MCP servers?

==== Verification Steps

. Create test plugin with `minVersion` higher than Claude Code version
. Test if installation is blocked
. Test plugin dependency declaration
. Document actual behavior

'''

=== 9. Platform-Specific Components 💡

==== What Needs Testing

**Documented in**: `plugin-structure.adoc:244` (metadata.platforms)

**Assumption**: `platforms: ["cli", "jetbrains", "vscode"]` is metadata only, not functional filtering.

**Questions**:
* Can components be platform-specific?
* Does Claude Code hide components based on platform?
* Or is this just documentation?

==== Why This Matters

Could enable platform-optimized agents if supported.

== Documentation Impact

Once research is completed, update the following documents:

=== If Skills Access WORKS as Assumed
* ✅ No changes needed
* Add verification note to `architecture-overview.adoc`

=== If Skills Access FAILS
* 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Update `architecture-overview.adoc` (entire Skills Access Mechanism section)
* 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Update `synchronize-command-spec.adoc` (Skills Access Pattern section)
* 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Revise architecture to use Alternative Approach (see §1.4)
* Update README.adoc to reflect new approach

'''

== Test Repository Setup

For research verification, create:

[source,bash]
----
# Test repository structure
test-plugin-research/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── skills/
│   └── test-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── standards/
│   └── test-standard.adoc
└── agents/
    └── test-agent.md
----

**Purpose**: Minimal test case for each research topic.

**Repository**: Should be public for testing web access.
