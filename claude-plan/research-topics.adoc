== Overview

This document records research findings that validated the plugin-only distribution approach for cui-standards plugin.

== Key Verified Findings

=== Plugin Component Distribution ✅ VERIFIED

**Research Date**: 2025-10-23

**Finding**: Plugins can distribute all three component types (skills, agents, commands)

**Evidence**:
* obra/superpowers - Plugin with skills, agents, commands working
* wshobson/agents - 85 agents, 47 skills distributed via plugins
* jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus - 227+ production plugins
* All three component types confirmed working after `/plugin install`

**Discovery Mechanism**:
* Commands appear in `/help` after installation
* Agents visible via `/agents` command
* Skills auto-activate based on context

**Impact**: Eliminates need for manual synchronization - plugin installation handles everything

=== Plugin Update Mechanism ✅ VERIFIED

**Research Date**: 2025-10-22

**Finding**: Plugin updates via marketplace refresh, not individual plugin commands

**Commands Verified**:
* `/plugin marketplace update marketplace-name` - ✅ Exists
* `/plugin update plugin-name` - ❌ Does NOT exist

**Update Workflow**:
```bash
/plugin marketplace update cui-llm-rules
/plugin install cui-standards@cui-llm-rules --force
```

=== Skills Loading at Runtime ✅ VERIFIED

**Research Date**: 2025-10-22

**Finding**: Skills load progressively from plugin directories

**Mechanism**:
1. Startup: Name + description loaded (lightweight)
2. Context matching: Claude determines relevance
3. Dynamic fetch: Full SKILL.md content loaded on-demand
4. Tool access: Skills use Read tool for standards files

**Paths**: Skills discovered from `~/.claude/plugins/*/skills/` automatically

=== ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} Environment Variable ❌ NOT AVAILABLE

**Research Date**: 2025-10-22

**Finding**: Variable does NOT exist

**Evidence**:
```bash
$ env | grep -E "PLUGIN|ROOT|CLAUDE"
CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli
CLAUDECODE=1
# No CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT found
```

**Available Variables**:
* `CLAUDECODE=1` - Indicates Claude Code environment
* `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli` - Platform identifier

**Solution**: Use relative paths (`./`) which resolve against plugin root automatically

== Architectural Impact

**Based on research findings, the following architectural decisions were made**:

1. **Plugin-only distribution** - All components via marketplace (verified working)
2. **Claude Code CLI only** - No web/CI/CD support (agents/commands are CLI-only features)
3. **Automatic discovery** - No manual synchronization needed
4. **Relative paths** - All paths use `./` prefix (no environment variable needed)

**Eliminated from specifications**:
* Manual synchronization workflows
* Git-based distribution
* Cross-platform complexity
* ZIP upload for web users

**Result**: Dramatically simplified architecture (~900 lines of specs removed)
