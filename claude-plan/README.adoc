== Overview

**DOCUMENT STATUS**: ‚úÖ Architectural specifications complete (as of 2025-10-22)

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: üìã Specifications ready for implementation - implementation has not yet begun

This directory contains the technical specifications for the `cui-standards` Claude Code plugin. These documents define the architecture, component structure, and implementation requirements for transforming cui-llm-rules into a distributable plugin.

**What you'll find here**: Complete specifications for architecture, component design, and distribution mechanisms

**What's NOT here**: Implementation code (to be developed based on these specifications)

== Document Index

=== xref:architecture-overview.adoc[Architecture Overview]

*Purpose*: High-level architectural design and layer model

*Contents*:

* Four-layer architecture (Standards, Skills, Agents, Commands)
* Visual architecture diagrams
* Key architectural decisions
* Current state analysis
* Installation and update procedures
* Version management strategy

*Audience*: Architects, technical leads, anyone needing to understand the overall design

---

=== xref:component-specifications.adoc[Component Specifications]

*Purpose*: Detailed technical specifications for Skills, Agents, and Commands

*Contents*:

* Skill structure and YAML frontmatter format
* Agent structure and Essential Rules Pattern
* Command structure and parameter support
* Path resolution rules
* Tool access patterns
* Complete examples for each component type

*Audience*: Developers implementing skills, agents, or commands

---

=== xref:plugin-structure.adoc[Plugin Structure Specification]

*Purpose*: Repository organization and plugin manifest requirements

*Contents*:

* Complete directory structure
* `plugin.json` manifest specification
* `marketplace.json` configuration
* Component discovery rules
* Path resolution requirements
* Version management

---

=== xref:synchronize-command-spec.adoc[Synchronize Command Specification]

*Purpose*: Project-specific synchronization for cross-platform compatibility

*Contents*:

* `/synchronize` command specification
* Synchronizing agents, commands, and skills to project `.claude/` (git-controlled)
* Skills synchronization required for cross-platform support
* Platform support (Claude Code, Claude.ai web, CI/CD)
* Update strategy, drift management, and team collaboration workflow

*Audience*: Developers setting up projects, teams using Claude.ai web or CI/CD

---

=== xref:research-topics.adoc[Research Topics: Requires Verification]

*Purpose*: Document assumptions that require empirical verification before implementation

*Contents*:

* Critical unknowns about Claude Code/Claude.ai capabilities
* Skills access from Claude.ai web (CRITICAL - could break architecture)
* Plugin update mechanisms and version pinning
* Test scenarios and acceptance criteria
* Alternative approaches if assumptions fail
* Research tracking and documentation impact

*Audience*: Architects, implementers - **MUST READ** before implementation begins

== Quick Reference

=== Core Architectural Decisions

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Decision |Approach |Rationale

|**Standards Layer**
|AsciiDoc files in `standards/`
|Single source of truth, version controlled

|**Skills Layer**
|SKILL.md files that reference standards
|Dynamic reads, always current, no duplication

|**Agents Layer**
|agent.md with Essential Rules (custom pattern)
|Performance (embedded) + Currency (skill references)

|**Distribution**
|Claude Code plugin via marketplace
|Native mechanism, automatic updates, team consistency
|===

=== Essential Rules Pattern

Agents embed core requirements for performance while referencing skills for complete standards.

**Details**: xref:component-specifications.adoc#essential-rules-pattern-custom-implementation[Component Specifications ¬ß Essential Rules Pattern]

=== Path Requirements

All paths must be relative to plugin root and start with `./`

See xref:plugin-structure.adoc#path-resolution[Plugin Structure ¬ß Path Resolution] for complete requirements.

=== Installation

See xref:plugin-structure.adoc#installation[Plugin Structure ¬ß Installation] for complete installation instructions including local development, GitHub repository, and project auto-installation.

=== Quick Start

For complete installation instructions, see:

* xref:plugin-structure.adoc#installation[Plugin Structure ¬ß Installation] - Detailed installation procedures
* xref:synchronize-command-spec.adoc[Synchronize Command Specification] - Cross-platform distribution
* xref:architecture-overview.adoc#implementation-decision-guide[Architecture Overview ¬ß Implementation Decision Guide] - Choose the right approach for your team

== Specification Scope

This directory contains complete specifications for:

* **Architecture**: Four-layer model (Standards, Skills, Agents, Commands)
* **Skills**: 4 skills (Java, Testing, Documentation, Process)
* **Agents**: 7 agents for task execution
* **Commands**: 11 commands including `/synchronize` for cross-platform distribution
* **Plugin Manifest**: Complete `plugin.json` specification
* **Research Topics**: Unverified assumptions requiring testing

== Verification Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

**Complete verification tracking**: See xref:research-topics.adoc[Research Topics] for detailed status of all assumptions and research items.

**Key verifications**:

* ‚úÖ Skills synchronization approach verified (Project Synchronization works on all platforms)
* ‚úÖ Plugin installation and marketplace mechanisms confirmed
* ‚úÖ YAML frontmatter structure validated
* ‚ùå `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable does NOT exist
* ‚è∏Ô∏è Dynamic repository access deferred (Project Synchronization is working solution)

== Known Limitations

See xref:plugin-structure.adoc#known-limitations[Plugin Structure ¬ß Known Limitations] for complete details.

**Key constraints**:

* **No individual plugin update command**: Use `/plugin marketplace update marketplace-name`
* **No semantic version pinning**: Version management via Git tags and marketplace `version` field
* **Relative paths required**: All paths must start with `./` (relative to plugin root)
* **Essential Rules**: Custom pattern requiring manual implementation and maintenance
