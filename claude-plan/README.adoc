== Overview

This directory contains technical specifications for the `cui-standards` Claude Code plugin - a plugin that distributes coding standards, development agents, and utility commands for CUI OSS projects.

**Target Platform**: Claude Code CLI only (terminal and VS Code)

**Distribution**: Plugin marketplace (single-command installation)

== Quick Start

```bash
# Install plugin
/plugin marketplace add cuioss/cui-llm-rules
/plugin install cui-standards@cui-llm-rules

# Verify installation
/help     # Shows commands
/agents   # Lists agents
```

That's it! All components (skills, agents, commands) are now available.

== Architecture Summary

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Layer |Implementation

|**Standards**
|AsciiDoc files in `standards/` (authoritative source)

|**Skills**
|SKILL.md files with dynamic standard references

|**Agents**
|agent.md with Essential Rules embedded + skill references

|**Commands**
|command.md for utility commands

|**Distribution**
|Plugin marketplace
|===

== Component Counts

* **Skills**: 4 skills (Java, Testing, Documentation, Process)
* **Agents**: 7 agents for development tasks
* **Commands**: 10 utility commands
* **Installation**: Single command

== Verification Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23

**Key Findings**:

* ✅ Plugin distribution works for all component types (skills, agents, commands)
* ✅ Automatic component discovery after installation
* ✅ No manual file management required
* ❌ Claude.ai web not supported (agents/commands are CLI-only features)
* ❌ CI/CD requires manual plugin configuration

See xref:research-topics.adoc[Research Topics] for complete evidence and sources.

== Key Design Decisions

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Decision |Approach |Rationale

|**Distribution**
|Plugin marketplace only
|Single installation command, automatic updates, no manual synchronization

|**Platform**
|Claude Code CLI only
|Agents/commands don't exist on web platform

|**Skills Pattern**
|Dynamic standard references
|Always current, no duplication

|**Agents Pattern**
|Essential Rules embedded
|Performance + completeness
