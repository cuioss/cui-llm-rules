:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Overview

This document provides the implementation plan for Phase 2 of skills migration, covering the remaining five skills after Phase 1 completion.

== Phase 2 Scope

Following Phase 1 (cui-java-core, cui-javadoc, cui-java-unit-testing), Phase 2 completes the skill ecosystem with:

1. **cui-java-cdi** - CDI and Quarkus development standards (highest conditional loading benefit among remaining)
2. **cui-frontend-development** - JavaScript, CSS, web components, and Cypress testing (large skill with high conditional benefit)
3. **cui-documentation** - General documentation standards (moderate size, clear boundaries)
4. **cui-project-setup** - Project initialization and configuration (supporting skill for new projects)
5. **cui-requirements** - Requirements engineering and planning (foundational process skill)

**Rationale**:

- **cui-java-cdi** first due to conditional loading benefits (testing/native contexts)
- **cui-frontend-development** next as it's a large, complex skill best tackled early
- **cui-documentation** follows with clear, well-defined boundaries
- **cui-project-setup** and **cui-requirements** last as supporting/process skills

----

=== Coexistence Strategy

**During Phase 2**:

- New skills created in `claude/marketplace/skills/`
- Existing standards remain in `standards/` unchanged
- Both structures exist in parallel
- No deletion of existing content until validation complete

**After Phase 2 completion**:

- All 8 skills complete and validated
- `standards/` directory can be deprecated
- Consider archiving to `standards-archive/` for reference

== Implementation Workflow

**For each skill, follow this workflow**:

1. **Implement** - Create skill structure, extract content, convert to Markdown, write SKILL.md
2. **Verify all validation criteria** - Check all completion criteria for the skill (see each skill's "Validation Criteria" section)
3. **Verify no information loss** - **CRITICAL**: Compare against original standards to ensure 100% content preservation
4. **Commit** - Commit the completed skill with descriptive message documenting zero information loss

**No skill is complete until**:

- All validation criteria checkboxes marked complete
- Content comparison confirms zero information loss
- Skill is committed to version control

== Skill 1: cui-java-cdi

=== Overview

**Target**: `claude/marketplace/skills/cui-java-cdi/`

**Priority**: Highest conditional loading benefit among remaining skills - testing and native compilation contexts provide significant savings.

# CUI Java CDI Skill

Standards and patterns for CDI and Quarkus development in CUI projects.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Applicable CDI Standards

**CRITICAL**: Load current CDI standards to use as enforcement criteria.

1. **Always load foundational CDI standards**:
   ```
   Read: standards/cdi-aspects.md
   Read: standards/cdi-container.md
   ```
   These provide core CDI patterns always needed for development.

2. **Conditional loading based on context**:

   - If writing CDI tests or integration tests:
     ```
     Read: standards/cdi-testing.md
     ```

   - If working with Quarkus native compilation:
     ```
     Read: standards/quarkus-native.md
     ```

3. **Extract key requirements from all loaded standards**

4. **Store in working memory** for use during task execution

### Step 2: Analyze Existing CDI Code

[... continue with workflow steps ...]

### Step 3: Apply CDI Standards to Development Task

[... workflow continues ...]

## Quality Verification

[... quality checks ...]

=== Migration Steps

1. **Create directory structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p claude/marketplace/skills/cui-java-cdi/standards
   ```

2. **Read existing CDI standards**:

   - Read: `standards/cdi-quarkus/container-standards.adoc`
   - Read: `standards/cdi-quarkus/testing-standards.adoc`
   - Read: `standards/process/quarkus-native-optimization.adoc`

3. **Convert to Markdown**:
   - Convert cdi-aspects.adoc → `cdi-aspects.md`
   - Convert container-standards.adoc → `cdi-container.md`
   - Convert testing-standards.adoc → `cdi-testing.md`
   - Convert quarkus-native-optimization.adoc → `quarkus-native.md`

   - Remove cross-references or convert to plain text
   - Remove "See Also" navigation sections
   - Preserve all code examples and explanations
   - Convert AsciiDoc lists to Markdown lists

5. **Create SKILL.md**:
   - YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools
   - Workflow with explicit Read instructions
   - Conditional loading logic for testing and native
   - Quality verification steps

6. **Validate no content loss**:
   - Compare line counts (content only, excluding navigation)

# CUI Project Setup Skill

Standards for initializing new CUI projects and configuring build and deployment pipelines.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Applicable Project Setup Standards

**CRITICAL**: Load current project setup standards.

1. **Always load foundational project setup standards**:
   ```
   Read: standards/new-project-guide.md
   Read: standards/project-structure.md
   ```
   These provide core project initialization and structure patterns.

2. **Conditional loading based on setup context**:

   - If setting up Maven project:
     ```
     Read: standards/maven-integration.md
     ```

   - If setting up or configuring CI/CD pipeline:
     ```
     Read: standards/cicd-pipeline.md
     ```

3. **Extract key requirements from all loaded standards**

4. **Store in working memory** for use during task execution

### Step 2: Analyze Current Project State

=== Migration Steps

1. **Create directory structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p claude/marketplace/skills/cui-project-setup/standards
   ```

2. **Read and extract from multiple sources**:
   - Read: `standards/requirements/new-project-guide.adoc`
   - Read: `standards/javascript/project-structure.adoc` (Maven sections)
   - Analyze existing project structures for patterns
   - Analyze existing CI/CD configurations

3. **Create standards files**:
   - Convert new-project-guide.adoc → `new-project-guide.md`
   - Create new `project-structure.md` from extracted patterns
   - Create `maven-integration.md` from Maven patterns
   - Create `cicd-pipeline.md` from CI/CD patterns

4. **Create SKILL.md** with conditional loading for Maven and CI/CD contexts

5. **Validate**:
   - Ensure project initialization checklist is complete
   - Verify Maven patterns are comprehensive
   - Check CI/CD guidance covers common scenarios

6. **Verify all validation criteria completed**

7. **Commit the skill**:
   ```bash
   git add claude/marketplace/skills/cui-project-setup

=== Migration Steps

1. **Create directory structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p claude/marketplace/skills/cui-requirements/standards
   ```

2. **Read existing requirements standards**:
   - Read: `standards/requirements/planning.adoc`
   - Read: `standards/requirements/specification-and-implementation.adoc`

3. **Convert to Markdown**:
   - Convert planning.adoc → `planning-standards.md`
   - Convert specification-and-implementation.adoc → `specification-standards.md`

4. **Create SKILL.md** with simple always-load pattern (no conditional logic)

5. **Validate**:
   - Verify all planning guidance preserved
   - Check all specification patterns documented
   - Ensure examples complete

6. **Verify all validation criteria completed**

7. **Commit the skill**:
   ```bash
   git add claude/marketplace/skills/cui-requirements
   git commit -m "feat: Add cui-requirements skill with always-loaded standards (Phase 2.5)

   - Create skill structure with SKILL.md and 2 standards files

== Quality Assurance

=== Content Loss Prevention

**Verification Method**: Side-by-side comparison (same as Phase 1)

For each skill:

1. **Line count comparison**:
   - Count content lines in original standards
   - Count content lines in new standards (excluding old navigation overhead)
   - Verify: new content ≥ original content - navigation overhead

2. **Section coverage**:
   - List all sections in original standards
   - Verify each section present in new standards
   - Document any intentional omissions (should be none)

3. **Code example preservation**:
   - Extract all code blocks from originals
   - Verify all code blocks in new standards
   - Ensure examples remain complete and accurate

4. **Requirement preservation**:
   - List all "must", "should", "shall" requirements in originals
   - Verify all requirements in new standards
   - Ensure no weakening of standards

=== Format Validation

**Markdown Syntax**:

- Run Markdown linter on all .md files
- Verify code fence syntax (` ```language`)
- Check heading hierarchy
- Validate link syntax (if any internal links)

**SKILL.md Validation**:

- Verify YAML frontmatter parses correctly
- Test Read instruction paths (files exist)
- Validate tool list completeness
- Check workflow structure

=== Functional Testing

**Skill Invocation Test**:

For each skill:

1. Invoke skill in test scenario
2. Verify standards files loaded correctly

- [ ] Final validation that no skills reference old standards

== Post-Phase 2 Activities

=== Standards Directory Deprecation

1. **Archive existing standards**:
   ```bash
   git mv standards standards-archive
   git commit -m "chore: Archive original standards after Phase 2 completion

   All content migrated to 8 marketplace skills"
   ```

2. **Update documentation**:
   - Update README to reference skills as primary documentation
   - Add migration guide for users
   - Document skill invocation patterns

3. **Verify no broken references**:
   - Check all SKILL.md files use correct paths
   - Verify no cross-references to archived standards
   - Test all skills load correctly

=== Skill Ecosystem Documentation

Create `claude/marketplace/skills/README.md`:

- Overview of all 8 skills
- Skill invocation patterns
- When to use which skill
- Multi-skill workflows (e.g., "Document my Java code" uses cui-java-core + cui-javadoc)
- Troubleshooting guide

=== Validation and Testing

1. **End-to-end testing**:
   - Test each skill individually
   - Test multi-skill workflows
   - Verify conditional loading works correctly
   - Measure token savings

2. **Documentation review**:
   - Ensure all SKILL.md files are clear
   - Verify all standards files are self-contained
   - Check for consistency across skills

3. **User acceptance**:
   - Validate skills meet user needs
   - Gather feedback on skill structure
   - Iterate on improvements

== Success Criteria

Phase 2 is complete when:

1. **All 5 skills created and committed**: cui-java-cdi, cui-frontend-development, cui-documentation, cui-project-setup, cui-requirements
2. **All validation criteria met**: Content completeness, format quality, functional verification for each skill
3. **Zero information loss confirmed**: All original standards content preserved in new structure
4. **Conditional loading validated**: Token savings measured and confirmed for applicable skills
5. **Standards directory archived**: Original standards moved to standards-archive/
6. **Documentation updated**: README, CLAUDE.md, and skill ecosystem documentation complete
7. **End-to-end testing passed**: All skills functional and working together

Total skill count after Phase 2: **8 skills** (3 from Phase 1 + 5 from Phase 2)
