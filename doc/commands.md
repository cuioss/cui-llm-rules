### Lessons Learned

#### Discovery 1: Transitional Documentation Patterns
Multiple files contained "DOCUMENT STATUS", "IMPLEMENTATION STATUS", and temporal markers like "transforms from" that indicated work-in-progress documentation. Status markers and transitional language create maintenance burden (need constant updates) and undermine the authoritative tone of technical specifications. Documentation should represent the current state, not track historical transitions.

**Suggested improvement**: Add explicit check in AsciiDoc review agent workflow:
- Pattern detection: `DOCUMENT STATUS`, `IMPLEMENTATION STATUS`, `transforms from`, `Status:.*âœ…`
- Category: "Transitional Content" (separate from general completeness)
- Impact: Faster detection of documentation that needs to transition from planning/development mode to production documentation mode

#### Discovery 2: Marketing Language in Technical Specifications
Production-focused phrasing appeared in technical specifications like "production-proven (227+ plugins)", "Simplest, most maintainable", and "HIGH confidence from multiple production examples". Technical specifications should be factual and neutral. Marketing language (even when factually grounded) creates inappropriate tone for architectural documentation.

**Suggested improvement**: Enhance tone analysis with context-specific rules:
- Technical specifications have stricter tone requirements than general documentation
- Add "Qualification Pattern" detection: Phrases like "HIGH confidence", "production-proven", "best-in-class" are red flags
- Distinguish between factual claims with sources vs promotional framing

#### Discovery 3: Anchor Addition for Cross-References
AsciiDoc cross-references using `xref:file.adoc#anchor-id[Label]` syntax require explicit anchor IDs before section headers. The syntax `[#anchor-id]` must appear on the line immediately before the section header. Missing anchors cause broken cross-references even when target sections exist.

**Suggested improvement**: Enhance link verification to distinguish:
- **Broken file reference**: Target file doesn't exist (Priority 1 - Critical)
- **Missing anchor**: File exists, section exists by title match, but anchor missing (Priority 2 - High)
- **Missing section**: File exists, no section matches anchor or title (Priority 1 - Critical)

Add anchor insertion workflow for automated fixing.

#### Discovery 4: Link Verification Script Path Resolution Bug
The verify-adoc-links.py script has a path resolution bug when checking relative xref links within the same directory - it tries to resolve "claude-plan" as a file path instead of recognizing it as part of a relative reference. This causes automated link verification to fail even when all links are valid, requiring manual verification as a workaround.

**Suggested improvement**: Enhance verify-adoc-links.py to properly handle xref: links that reference files in the same directory (e.g., `xref:file.adoc[Label]` should resolve to `./file.adoc` from the current file's directory). Future reviews would benefit from a fixed script that correctly validates same-directory cross-references without manual intervention.
