### Lessons Learned

#### Discovery 1: Transitional Documentation Patterns
Multiple files contained "DOCUMENT STATUS", "IMPLEMENTATION STATUS", and temporal markers like "transforms from" that indicated work-in-progress documentation. Status markers and transitional language create maintenance burden (need constant updates) and undermine the authoritative tone of technical specifications. Documentation should represent the current state, not track historical transitions.

**Suggested improvement**: Add explicit check in AsciiDoc review agent workflow:
- Pattern detection: `DOCUMENT STATUS`, `IMPLEMENTATION STATUS`, `transforms from`, `Status:.*âœ…`
- Category: "Transitional Content" (separate from general completeness)
- Impact: Faster detection of documentation that needs to transition from planning/development mode to production documentation mode

#### Discovery 2: Marketing Language in Technical Specifications
Production-focused phrasing appeared in technical specifications like "production-proven (227+ plugins)", "Simplest, most maintainable", and "HIGH confidence from multiple production examples". Technical specifications should be factual and neutral. Marketing language (even when factually grounded) creates inappropriate tone for architectural documentation.

**Suggested improvement**: Enhance tone analysis with context-specific rules:
- Technical specifications have stricter tone requirements than general documentation
- Add "Qualification Pattern" detection: Phrases like "HIGH confidence", "production-proven", "best-in-class" are red flags
- Distinguish between factual claims with sources vs promotional framing
