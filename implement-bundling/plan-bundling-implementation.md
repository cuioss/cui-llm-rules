# Plugin Bundling Implementation: Transform marketplace structure into functional bundles

**Issue Reference:** /Users/oliver/git/cui-llm-rules/implement-bundling/BUNDLING-ANALYSIS.md

---

## Instructions for Implementation Agent

**CRITICAL:** Implement tasks **ONE AT A TIME** in the order listed below.

After implementing each task:
1. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
2. Run all quality checks (validate JSON, test paths, verify structure)
3. Mark the task as done: `[x]`
4. Only proceed to next task when current task is 100% complete

**Do NOT skip ahead.** Each task builds on previous tasks.
