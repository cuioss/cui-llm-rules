== Overview

Design principles and quality standards for Claude Code agents.

**Audience**: Agent creators and reviewers

**Related**: xref:plugin-architecture.adoc[Architecture] · xref:plugin-specifications.adoc[Specifications]

== Core Principles

=== 1. Standards via Skills

**Rule**: Agents load standards using the Skill tool, not direct file reads.

**Implementation**:

* Declare `Skill` in tools list
* Invoke `Skill: cui-skill-name` in workflow Step 0
* Skills are self-contained bundles that read their own standards
* Never use direct file references (`../../../../` or `~/git/`)

**Example**:
```yaml
tools: Read, Edit, Skill
```
```markdown
### Step 0: Activate Skills
Skill: cui-java-core
Skill: cui-javadoc
```

=== 2. Perfect Tool Fit (100%)

**Rule**: Agent has exactly the tools it needs - no more, no less.

**Why**: Missing tools require user approval (breaks autonomy), extra tools mislead about capabilities.

**Enforcement**: `/cui-diagnose-agents` verifies tool coverage.

**Tool Dependencies**:

* `Edit` requires `Read`
* Standards usage requires `Skill`
* Git commands require `Bash`

=== 3. No Self-Modification

**Rule**: Agents report lessons learned but never modify themselves.

**Why**: Agents invoked by system (not user), modifications require restart, creates race conditions.

**Implementation**: Include "Lessons Learned" in response format.

=== 4. Structured Response Format

**Required elements**:

* Status: ✅ SUCCESS | ❌ FAILURE | ⚠️ PARTIAL
* Summary: 1-2 sentences
* Metrics: Quantified results
* Tool Usage: Count per tool
* Lessons Learned: Insights for improvement

== Agent Structure

=== Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: When to use with examples
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Skill
model: sonnet
color: green|blue|purple
---
```

=== Required Sections

```markdown
## YOUR TASK
{Clear, specific task definition}

## SKILLS USED
- **skill-name**: Description
  - Provides: {standards provided}
  - When activated: Step 0

## WORKFLOW (FOLLOW EXACTLY)

### Step 0: Activate Skills
Skill: cui-skill-name

### Step 1-N: Task Steps
{Numbered, specific instructions}

## RESPONSE FORMAT
{Structured output template with required elements}
```

== Agent vs Command

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Aspect |Command |Agent

|Invocation
|User types `/command`
|System via Task tool

|Duration
|Can be hours/days
|< 30 minutes

|Interaction
|Frequent questions
|Minimal (decisions only)

|Self-modify
|✅ Continuous improvement
|❌ Lessons learned only

|Standards
|Direct file reads OK
|Skills via Skill tool

|Output
|Flexible
|Structured, parseable
|===

**Use Agent When**:

* Well-defined autonomous task
* No user interaction during execution
* Single-session completion
* Structured output needed

== Writing Quality Standards

=== Clarity

* Quantify thresholds ("3 retries", not "several")
* Use concrete verbs ("validate", "parse", not "handle")
* Define explicit criteria ("exit code 0", not "succeeds")
* Enumerate all options in decision points

=== Specificity

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|❌ Avoid |✅ Use

|"if needed"
|"if error count > 0"

|"appropriately"
|"using format YYYY-MM-DD"

|"handle errors"
|"catch IOException, log, retry once"

|"fairly short"
|"3-5 sentences" or "< 200 words"
|===

=== Error Handling

Define for each error type:

* Retry count (explicit number)
* Retry conditions (which errors)
* Backoff strategy (immediate, exponential, fixed)
* Final action after exhaustion

=== Measurability

All conditions must be boolean-evaluable:

* ✅ "Retry up to 3 times"
* ❌ "Retry several times"
* ✅ "Success = exit code 0 AND no ERROR lines"
* ❌ "Success = build completes successfully"

== Validation

=== Tool: /cui-diagnose-agents

**Checks**:

* ✅ Tool Fit Score = 100%
* ✅ Agents using standards invoke skills properly
* ✅ No direct file references
* ✅ No self-modification
* ✅ Valid frontmatter
* ✅ Structured response format

**Usage**:
```bash
/cui-diagnose-agents           # Marketplace agents
/cui-diagnose-agents global    # Global agents
/cui-diagnose-agents project   # Project agents
```

**Auto-fixes**:

* Adds/removes tools for 100% fit
* Adds Skill tool if missing
* Converts file refs to skill invocations

=== Quality Checklist

Before creating agent:

* [ ] Clear, quantified instructions (no "appropriately", "if needed")
* [ ] All thresholds have explicit numbers
* [ ] Error handling defined per error type
* [ ] Success criteria are measurable
* [ ] SKILLS USED section documents required skills
* [ ] Step 0 activates skills via Skill tool
* [ ] Only required tools configured (including Skill if using standards)
* [ ] Structured response format defined
* [ ] Tool Fit Score = 100% (verify with `/cui-diagnose-agents`)

== Common Anti-Patterns

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|❌ Anti-Pattern |✅ Correct Pattern

|"Process files as needed"
|"Process all .java files in src/main/java"

|"Build succeeds"
|"exit code 0 AND no ERROR lines"

|"Handle exceptions appropriately"
|"Catch FileNotFoundException → log, skip. IOException → retry once, fail"

|"If file is too large..."
|"If file size > 10MB..."

|`Read: ~/git/cui-llm-rules/standards/java.adoc`
|`Skill: cui-java-core`

|tools: Read, Edit
(workflow uses Skill)
|tools: Read, Edit, Skill
|===

== Reference Template

See `.claude/agents/maven-project-builder.md` for fully compliant implementation:

* ✅ Perfect Tool Fit (100%)
* ✅ Proper skill loading (Step 0)
* ✅ SKILLS USED documentation
* ✅ Structured response format
* ✅ Complete frontmatter
