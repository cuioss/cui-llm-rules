# CUI Maven Rules

Comprehensive Maven standards for CUI projects covering build verification, POM maintenance, dependency management, Maven wrapper updates, and integration with build tools.

## What This Skill Provides

### Maven Build Standards
- Pre-commit profile configuration and execution
- Build success criteria and verification
- Quality gate enforcement
- Execution time tracking and optimization
- Error and warning analysis
- OpenRewrite marker handling

### POM Maintenance Standards
- BOM (Bill of Materials) management
- Dependency management with properties
- Version naming conventions (version.*, maven.*.plugin.version)
- Scope optimization (compile, provided, runtime, test)
- OpenRewrite integration for automated cleanup
- Maven wrapper updates and maintenance

### Maven Integration Standards
- Frontend-maven-plugin configuration for JavaScript
- Node.js and npm version management
- Maven phase integration (validate, compile, test, etc.)
- SonarQube integration and coverage reporting
- CI/CD build environment standards

### Quality Standards
- Compilation error resolution
- Test failure handling
- Code warning fixes
- JavaDoc mandatory fixes
- Dependency analysis
- Acceptable warning management

## When to Activate This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- Building Maven projects with quality checks
- Analyzing Maven build output
- Fixing Maven build errors or warnings
- Maintaining POM files
- Managing dependencies or BOMs
- Updating Maven wrappers
- Integrating JavaScript tooling with Maven
- Setting up CI/CD Maven builds
- Troubleshooting Maven issues

## Standards Organization

All standards are organized in the `standards/` directory:

- `pom-maintenance.md` - Comprehensive POM maintenance process, BOM management, dependency management, scope optimization
- `maven-integration.md` - Maven integration with JavaScript, frontend-maven-plugin, SonarQube integration

## Tool Access

This skill requires:
- **Read**: To load standards files
- **Grep**: To search for patterns in standards

## Usage Pattern

When this skill is activated, it loads all Maven-related standards into the agent's context. Agents can then reference these standards when:

1. **Executing builds**: Understanding build success criteria, quality gates
2. **Fixing issues**: Knowing how to handle errors, warnings, JavaDoc issues, OpenRewrite markers
3. **Maintaining POMs**: Following BOM patterns, property naming, dependency management rules
4. **Optimizing dependencies**: Applying scope rules, consolidation criteria
5. **Integrating tools**: Configuring frontend-maven-plugin, SonarQube properties
6. **Updating wrappers**: Following Maven wrapper update procedures

## Integration with Agents

### maven-project-builder Agent

The `maven-project-builder` agent activates this skill at workflow start (Step 0) to:
- Load build verification standards
- Understand quality gate criteria
- Know how to handle OpenRewrite markers
- Follow JavaDoc fix requirements
- Apply acceptable warning rules
- Track execution duration properly

The skill provides the authoritative standards that guide all build-related decisions and fixes.

## Standards Coverage

### Build Process
- ✅ Pre-commit profile execution
- ✅ Build success criteria (exit code, BUILD SUCCESS text, no ERROR lines)
- ✅ Timeout calculation (duration * 1.25 safety margin)
- ✅ Output analysis patterns
- ✅ Iteration workflow

### Issue Handling
- ✅ Compilation error fixes
- ✅ Test failure resolution
- ✅ Code warning handling
- ✅ JavaDoc mandatory fixes (NEVER optional)
- ✅ OpenRewrite marker auto-suppression (LogRecord, Exception)
- ✅ Acceptable warning management

### POM Maintenance
- ✅ BOM implementation patterns
- ✅ Property naming conventions
- ✅ Dependency aggregation rules
- ✅ Scope optimization guidelines
- ✅ Version management (handled by Dependabot)
- ✅ OpenRewrite recipe execution

### Maven Integration
- ✅ Frontend-maven-plugin configuration
- ✅ Node.js version management (v20.12.2)
- ✅ Maven phase mapping
- ✅ SonarQube properties
- ✅ CI/CD integration

## Related Skills

- **cui-javadoc**: JavaDoc standards used for mandatory JavaDoc fixes
- **cui-java-unit-testing**: Testing standards referenced in build verification
- **cui-frontend-development**: JavaScript standards for Maven integration

## Maintenance Notes

Standards in this skill are authoritative for:
- All Maven build processes in CUI projects
- All POM maintenance activities
- All Maven-related quality checks
- All Maven integration configurations

When standards need updates, modify the files in the `standards/` directory and the skill will automatically reflect the changes when next activated.
