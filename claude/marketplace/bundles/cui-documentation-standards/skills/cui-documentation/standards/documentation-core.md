# Documentation Core Standards

## Purpose
Comprehensive standards for all documentation across CUI projects, including general documentation rules and principles.

## Key Principles

1. **Consistency**: All documentation follows the same patterns and conventions
2. **Completeness**: Documentation covers all necessary aspects of the code
3. **Clarity**: Documentation is clear and understandable
4. **Maintainability**: Documentation is easy to update and maintain

## Core Documentation Standards

### Tone and Style Requirements

**MANDATORY**: All documentation must use:

* Professional, neutral, and objective tone
* No marketing language or promotional wording
* Factual descriptions with verifiable sources
* Technical precision without subjective claims
* Concise, clear language without verbosity

### General Principles

* Only document existing code elements - no speculative or planned features
* All references must be verified to exist
* Use linking instead of duplication
* Code examples must come from actual unit tests
* Use consistent terminology across all documentation
* All public APIs must be documented
* All changes require successful documentation build

### Terminology Standards

* Maintain consistent technical terminology
* Apply terminology consistently across all documentation types
* Follow project glossary and naming conventions
* Use technical terms consistently

### Code Example Requirements

#### Technical Requirements

* Must be complete and compilable
* Include all necessary imports
* Show proper error handling
* Follow project coding standards
* Be verified by unit tests

#### Structure Requirements

* Start with setup/configuration
* Show main functionality
* Include error handling
* Demonstrate cleanup if needed
* Use clear variable names
* Include comments for complex steps
