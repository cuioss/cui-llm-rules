## Usage Examples

### Core Java Development

```java
// Using DSL-style constants (cui-java-core)
public interface ConfigKeys {
    String API_URL = "api.url";
    String TIMEOUT = "api.timeout";
}

// Null safety with @NullMarked (cui-java-core)
@NullMarked
package de.cuioss.example;

// Using Lombok @Delegate (cui-java-core)
@Getter
public class UserWrapper {
    @Delegate
    private final User user;
}
```

### CDI Integration

```java
// CDI producer with lifecycle (cui-java-cdi)
@ApplicationScoped
public class ConfigProducer {

    @Produces
    @Startup
    public Configuration produceConfig() {
        return Configuration.load();
    }
}

// Integration test setup (cui-java-cdi)
@QuarkusTest
class ServiceTest {
    @Inject
    MyService service;

    @Test
    void shouldProcessData() {
        // test implementation
    }
}
```

### Unit Testing

```java
// Using test generators (cui-java-unit-testing)
@Test
void shouldTestValueObject() {
    var generator = new ValueObjectGenerator<>(User.class);
    generator.assertBasicValueObjectContract();
}

// JUnit 5 best practices (cui-java-unit-testing)
@Nested
@DisplayName("User Authentication")
class AuthenticationTests {

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Should authenticate valid user")
    void shouldAuthenticateValidUser() {
        // test implementation
    }
}
```
