## Schema Compliance

The marketplace.json structure complies with the Claude Code marketplace schema:

- ✅ Owner as object (not string)
- ✅ Plugin names in kebab-case (no spaces)
- ✅ Valid `source` field for each plugin
- ✅ Skills array with relative paths
- ✅ No unrecognized keys (removed: `id`, `type`, `path`, `category`, `version`)
- ✅ Proper metadata structure

**Note**: This metadata structure enables the CUI marketplace to be discoverable and installable as a plugin marketplace in Claude Code, providing centralized access to all CUI development standards and skills.
