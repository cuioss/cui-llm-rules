== Overview

This document contains the comprehensive documentation standards for all CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for documentation requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes. They ensure consistent, thorough, and maintainable documentation across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The documentation standards are organized into the following documents:

* `general-standard.adoc` - Core documentation standards and best practices (this document)
* xref:asciidoc-standards.adoc[AsciiDoc Standards] - Comprehensive AsciiDoc formatting, grammar, and best practices
* xref:tone-and-style-standards.adoc[Tone and Style Standards] - Professional tone, neutral language, and writing style requirements
* xref:organization-standards.adoc[Organization Standards] - Documentation organization, structure, and review guidelines
* xref:javadoc-standards.adoc[Javadoc Standards] - Specific standards for Javadoc documentation
* xref:readme-structure.adoc[README Structure] - Standard structure for README.adoc files

== Key Principles

1. *Consistency*: All documentation follows the same patterns and conventions
2. *Completeness*: Documentation covers all necessary aspects of the code
3. *Clarity*: Documentation is clear and understandable
4. *Maintainability*: Documentation is easy to update and maintain

== Purpose
Defines comprehensive standards for all documentation across the codebase, including general documentation rules and principles.

== Core Documentation Standards

=== Tone and Style Requirements

**MANDATORY**: All documentation must strictly adhere to xref:tone-and-style-standards.adoc[Tone and Style Standards] including:

* Professional, neutral, and objective tone
* No marketing language or promotional wording
* Factual descriptions with verifiable sources
* Technical precision without subjective claims
* Concise, clear language without verbosity

See the comprehensive xref:tone-and-style-standards.adoc[Tone and Style Standards] document for detailed guidelines, examples, and analysis patterns.

=== AsciiDoc Formatting Requirements

**MANDATORY**: All documentation must strictly adhere to xref:asciidoc-standards.adoc[AsciiDoc Standards] including:

* Proper document structure with required header attributes
* Standardized cross-reference syntax using `xref:` format
* Blank lines before all lists (critical formatting requirement)
* Correct code block formatting with language specification
* Proper section hierarchy and numbering

=== General Principles

* Only document existing code elements - no speculative or planned features
* All references must be verified to exist
* Use linking instead of duplication
* Code examples must come from actual unit tests
* Use consistent terminology across all documentation
* All public APIs must be documented
* All changes require successful documentation build

=== Terminology Standards

* Maintain "Java Bean Specification" terminology
* Apply consistently across all documentation types
* Follow project glossary and naming conventions
* Use technical terms consistently

=== Code Example Requirements
==== Technical Requirements

* Must be complete and compilable
* Include all necessary imports
* Show proper error handling
* Follow project coding standards
* Be verified by unit tests

==== Structure Requirements

* Start with setup/configuration
* Show main functionality
* Include error handling
* Demonstrate cleanup if needed
* Use clear variable names
* Include comments for complex steps
