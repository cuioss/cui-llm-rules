== Purpose
Defines comprehensive standards for organizing, reviewing, and maintaining documentation structure, including file organization, naming conventions, size limits, and quality review processes for all CUI projects.

== Related Documentation

* xref:asciidoc-standards.adoc[AsciiDoc Standards]: Comprehensive AsciiDoc formatting, grammar, and best practices
* xref:javadoc-standards.adoc[Javadoc Standards]: Specific standards for Javadoc documentation
* xref:readme-structure.adoc[README Structure]: Standard structure for README.adoc files

== File Organization Standards

=== Single Aspect Principle
Each document should represent one coherent aspect or domain:


* **Focused Scope**: Document covers one specific technology, process, or domain area
* **Clear Boundaries**: No overlap between documents - use cross-references instead
* **Logical Grouping**: Related concepts within the same document should flow logically
* **Separation of Concerns**: Configuration, rules, and integration kept in separate documents when appropriate

=== Document Size Guidelines

=== Optimal Size Limits
Documents should maintain optimal size for readability and maintainability:


* **Minimum Size**: 50 lines (excluding headers and TOC)
* **Maximum Size**: 400 lines (including all content)
* **Target Range**: 100-300 lines for most comprehensive documents
* **Exception Handling**: Documents exceeding 400 lines should be split into focused components

=== Size-Based Actions

**Oversized Documents (>400 lines)**:

* Split into logical components based on content sections
* Create overview document that cross-references split components
* Maintain comprehensive coverage while improving navigation
* Update all cross-references to new document structure

**Undersized Documents (<50 lines)**:

* Evaluate for consolidation with related documents
* Consider integration into parent or related documents
* Maintain as standalone only if serving unique, specific purpose
* Ensure adequate depth of coverage for the topic

=== File Naming Standards

=== Naming Convention
All documentation files must follow consistent kebab-case naming:


* **Format**: `descriptive-name.adoc`
* **Character Set**: Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
* **Descriptive**: Name clearly indicates document content and scope
* **Consistent**: Similar documents use parallel naming patterns
* **No Abbreviations**: Use full, clear names rather than abbreviations

=== Naming Examples

**Correct Naming**:

* `javascript-best-practices.adoc`
* `eslint-configuration.adoc`
* `integration-testing-standards.adoc`
* `css-design-system.adoc`

**Incorrect Naming**:

* `JavaScript_BestPractices.adoc` (mixed case, underscores)
* `eslint_config.adoc` (underscore, abbreviation)
* `IntegrationTestingStandards.adoc` (camelCase)

== Documentation Review Guidelines

=== Quality Standards
Comprehensive review process ensures documentation quality:


* **Consistency**: Uniform terminology, formatting, and structure across all documents
* **Completeness**: All standards areas fully documented without gaps
* **Correctness**: Technical information and cross-references validated
* **Focus**: Content concise but preserves all essential information

=== Content Requirements

**No Duplication**:

* Eliminate duplicate information across documents
* Use cross-references instead of repeating content
* Maintain single source of truth for each concept
* Reference shared concepts rather than duplicating

**Current State Only**:

* Document present requirements only
* Remove transitional, status, or deprecation information  
* Eliminate "changed from X to Y" references
* Focus on current technical requirements

**Source Attribution**:

* Always link to authoritative sources when referencing external standards
* Provide proper citations for best practices
* Include relevant external documentation links
* Maintain traceability to original sources

**Standards Linking**:

* Cross-reference related standards documents using `xref:` syntax
* Maintain logical navigation between related documents
* Create clear document hierarchy and relationships
* Update cross-references when restructuring content

== Document Maintenance Standards

=== Structural Maintenance

**Cross-Reference Integrity**:

* Update all cross-references when restructuring content
* Verify all `xref:` links remain valid after changes
* Test link integrity during document updates
* Maintain proper document relationships

**Formatting Consistency**:

* Maintain AsciiDoc formatting conventions
* Use standard document header structure
* Ensure proper table of contents configuration
* Apply consistent section numbering

**Content Focus**:

* Focus on technical requirements rather than implementation procedures
* Maintain clear separation between standards and processes
* Emphasize "what" rather than "how" in standards documents
* Keep implementation details in separate process documents

=== File Structure Adaptation

**Reorganization Authority**:

* Adapt structure when necessary to improve logical organization
* Reorganize files and directories for better usability
* Split overly broad documents into focused components
* Consolidate fragmented information into coherent documents

**Logical Linking**:

* Use README files to provide overview and navigation
* Link related documents together in coherent structure
* Create clear entry points for each domain area
* Maintain hierarchical organization within directories

== AsciiDoc Formatting Standards

=== Required Formatting Rules

**Document Header**:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
:toc: left
:toclevels: 3
:toc-title: Table of Contents
:sectnums:
:source-highlighter: highlight.js
----

**List Formatting**:

* Always include blank line before any list (bulleted, numbered, or definition)
* Maintain consistent indentation for nested lists
* Use proper AsciiDoc list syntax

**Code Block Formatting**:

* Include language specification for syntax highlighting
* Use proper source block delimiters
* Maintain consistent indentation within code blocks

**Cross-Reference Syntax**:

* Use `xref:path/to/document.adoc[Link Text]` for internal references
* Provide descriptive link text that indicates target content
* Use relative paths from current document location

=== Grammar and Style

**AsciiDoc Grammar**:

* Consult AsciiDoc documentation when uncertain about syntax
* Ensure proper section hierarchy and numbering
* Use consistent heading patterns across documents
* Validate document structure before finalizing

**Content Style**:

* Use clear, professional technical writing
* Maintain active voice where appropriate
* Use consistent terminology throughout document
* Structure content logically with clear section flow

== Review Process Standards

=== Comprehensive Review Scope

**Document Analysis**:

* Review all documents for size compliance (50-400 lines)
* Identify oversized documents requiring split
* Identify undersized documents for potential consolidation
* Assess file naming consistency across all documents

**Content Quality Review**:

* Eliminate duplicate information across documents
* Remove transitional or status information
* Verify cross-reference accuracy and consistency
* Ensure current-state focus throughout all content

**Structural Assessment**:

* Evaluate logical organization within and across documents
* Assess single-aspect compliance for each document
* Review file naming for consistency and clarity
* Validate overall documentation architecture

=== Implementation Standards

**Change Management**:

* Update cross-references immediately after restructuring
* Maintain document relationships during reorganization
* Preserve all essential technical information during changes
* Test navigation and link integrity after modifications

**Quality Assurance**:

* Verify AsciiDoc formatting compliance
* Validate proper list and code block formatting
* Ensure consistent document header structure
* Check table of contents and section numbering

== Integration with Development Process
