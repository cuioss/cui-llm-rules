== Overview

This document defines comprehensive tone and style standards for all technical documentation in CUI projects. These standards ensure documentation maintains a professional, neutral, and objective voice appropriate for technical audiences.

== Purpose

Technical documentation serves to inform, educate, and guide users and developers. The tone and style must reflect this purpose through:

* **Clarity**: Information presented in clear, understandable language
* **Objectivity**: Facts and technical details without subjective opinions
* **Professionalism**: Appropriate formality and respect for the audience
* **Consistency**: Uniform voice and style across all documentation

== Core Principles

=== Neutral and Professional Tone

**Required Characteristics:**

* Technical, professional voice throughout
* Neutral presentation of information
* Objective descriptions of functionality
* Factual statements with verifiable sources
* Appropriate formality for technical audience

**Prohibited Characteristics:**

* Marketing language or promotional wording
* Self-praise or superlative claims
* Subjective opinions without attribution
* Casual or overly informal language
* Emotional or persuasive writing

=== Objective vs Subjective Language

==== Objective Language (Use This)

Objective language presents facts, technical specifications, and verifiable information:

* "This library implements RFC 7519 for JWT validation"
* "The algorithm has O(n log n) time complexity"
* "Configuration supports three authentication modes"
* "The API follows REST principles as defined in Roy Fielding's dissertation"

==== Subjective Language (Avoid This)

Subjective language includes opinions, marketing claims, or unverifiable statements:

* ❌ "This is the best JWT library available"
* ❌ "Our innovative approach revolutionizes authentication"
* ❌ "Blazingly fast performance"
* ❌ "The easiest API you'll ever use"

== Prohibited Content Patterns

=== Marketing Language

Marketing language attempts to sell or promote rather than inform.

**Examples to Avoid:**

* ❌ "Revolutionary new features"
* ❌ "Cutting-edge technology"
* ❌ "Industry-leading performance"
* ❌ "State-of-the-art implementation"
* ❌ "Powerful capabilities"
* ❌ "Seamless integration"

**Correct Alternatives:**

* ✅ "New features in version 2.0"
* ✅ "Implementation based on [specific standard]"
* ✅ "Performance benchmarks: [specific metrics]"
* ✅ "Implementation following [specific pattern]"
* ✅ "Capabilities: [list specific features]"
* ✅ "Integration via [specific mechanism]"

=== Self-Praise and Superlatives

Self-praise elevates the project beyond objective assessment.

**Examples to Avoid:**

* ❌ "Excellent error handling"
* ❌ "Superior design"
* ❌ "The most comprehensive solution"
* ❌ "Unmatched flexibility"
* ❌ "Best-in-class architecture"

**Correct Alternatives:**

* ✅ "Error handling includes: [list specific error types]"
* ✅ "Design follows [specific pattern/principle]"
* ✅ "Features include: [complete list]"
* ✅ "Supports: [list configuration options]"
* ✅ "Architecture based on [specific style]"

=== Promotional Wording

Promotional wording attempts to persuade rather than describe.

**Examples to Avoid:**

* ❌ "You'll love how easy this is"
* ❌ "Simply add one line of code"
* ❌ "Effortlessly handles complex scenarios"
* ❌ "Makes your life easier"
* ❌ "Instantly improves performance"

**Correct Alternatives:**

* ✅ "Configuration requires: [specific steps]"
* ✅ "Add the following dependency: [code]"
* ✅ "Handles scenarios: [list specific cases]"
* ✅ "Provides: [specific capabilities]"
* ✅ "Performance characteristics: [specific metrics]"

=== Unverified Claims

All factual claims must be verifiable or properly attributed.

**Examples Requiring Verification:**

* ❌ "Industry standard practice" (without citation)
* ❌ "Commonly used approach" (without reference)
* ❌ "Improves performance by 50%" (without benchmarks)
* ❌ "Widely adopted pattern" (without examples)

**Correct Approaches:**

* ✅ "Practice recommended in [source/standard]"
* ✅ "Approach described in [citation]"
* ✅ "Benchmark results: [link to data]"
* ✅ "Pattern used by [specific projects/frameworks]"
* ✅ "According to [authoritative source], ..."

== Required Content Patterns

=== Technical Precision

Use precise technical language that accurately describes functionality.

**Good Examples:**

* ✅ "Validates JWT signatures using HMAC SHA-256"
* ✅ "Implements OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow as defined in RFC 6749"
* ✅ "Provides thread-safe token cache with configurable TTL"
* ✅ "Supports PKCE extension per RFC 7636"

=== Factual Descriptions

Present features and capabilities as factual statements.

**Good Examples:**

* ✅ "The library includes three validation modes: strict, lenient, and custom"
* ✅ "Configuration options are documented in [location]"
* ✅ "Compatibility: Java 11 and higher"
* ✅ "Dependencies: [list with versions]"

=== Attributed Sources

When referencing standards, specifications, or external sources, provide attribution.

**Required Pattern:**

```asciidoc
As specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[RFC 7519], JWT tokens consist of three parts: header, payload, and signature.
```

**Components:**

* Link to authoritative source
* Clear indication of what comes from that source
* Accurate representation of the source material

== Clarity Standards

=== Concise Writing

Avoid verbose or redundant passages.

**Verbose (Avoid):**

❌ "This library provides functionality that allows developers to perform validation of JWT tokens in a way that ensures security and compliance with industry standards through comprehensive checking mechanisms."

**Concise (Use):**

✅ "This library validates JWT tokens according to RFC 7519 security requirements."

=== Direct Language

Use direct, straightforward language without unnecessary complexity.

**Indirect (Avoid):**

❌ "It should be noted that there exists a possibility for configuring the validation process in such a manner that..."

**Direct (Use):**

✅ "Configure validation by setting..."

=== No Jargon Without Explanation

Technical terms are acceptable when properly introduced.

**Bad (Jargon Unexplained):**

❌ "Uses PKCE for enhanced security."

**Good (Jargon Explained):**

✅ "Uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to prevent authorization code interception attacks, as defined in RFC 7636."

== Humor and Personality

=== Minimal Humor Only

Humor is generally avoided in technical documentation. When used, it must be:

* Genuinely suitable for the context
* Not at the expense of clarity
* Professional and inoffensive
* Minimal (rare exceptions only)

**Generally Avoid:**

* Jokes or puns in API documentation
* Casual references or pop culture
* Sarcasm or irony
* Easter eggs in technical content

**Acceptable (Rare):**

* Brief, professional wit in blog posts or tutorials
* Self-deprecating humor about known limitations (if factual)
* Historical anecdotes if directly relevant

**Example of Acceptable:**

✅ "Note: Early versions named this parameter `magicFlag`. We've since learned to be more descriptive."

== Voice and Tense

=== Active vs Passive Voice

**Prefer Active Voice:**

* ✅ "The library validates tokens"
* ✅ "Call `validate()` to check the token"
* ✅ "The parser throws `InvalidTokenException`"

**Passive Voice (Acceptable for Processes):**

* ✅ "Tokens are validated against the configured issuer"
* ✅ "Errors are logged to the specified output"

=== Present Tense

Use present tense for describing current functionality.

**Good Examples:**

* ✅ "The method returns a validated token"
* ✅ "Configuration accepts three parameters"
* ✅ "Errors are reported via exceptions"

**Avoid Future Tense for Current Features:**

* ❌ "The method will return a token"
* ❌ "Configuration will accept parameters"

== Consistency Standards

=== Terminology Consistency

Use consistent terms throughout documentation.

**Examples:**

* If you use "JWT token" in one place, don't switch to "JSON Web Token" elsewhere without good reason
* If you call something a "validator", don't alternate with "checker" or "verifier"
* Maintain consistent parameter names across examples

=== Formatting Consistency

Apply consistent formatting to similar elements.

**Examples:**

* All method names in backticks: `validate()`
* All configuration properties in same format: `oauth.issuer.url`
* All code examples with proper language specification
* All warnings formatted identically

=== Style Consistency

Maintain uniform style across documentation.

**Examples:**

* If one README uses bullet points for features, others should too
* If one guide uses numbered steps, maintain that pattern
* If one document uses second person ("you"), be consistent

== Analysis Guidelines

=== Identifying Tone Issues

When reviewing documentation, assess each statement:

1. **Is this factual or subjective?**
   - Factual: Can be verified, measured, or tested
   - Subjective: Opinion, feeling, or qualitative judgment

2. **Is this neutral or promotional?**
   - Neutral: Describes without selling
   - Promotional: Attempts to persuade or impress

3. **Is this technical or marketing?**
   - Technical: Specifies how something works
   - Marketing: Emphasizes why someone should use it

4. **Is this precise or vague?**
   - Precise: Specific, measurable, clear
   - Vague: General, ambiguous, unclear

=== Fixing Tone Issues

For each identified issue:

**Step 1: Identify the Problem**

* What makes this text problematic?
* Which principle does it violate?
* What is the underlying intent?

**Step 2: Determine the Fix**

* What factual information can replace the subjective claim?
* How can this be stated neutrally?
* What technical details are needed?
* What source or attribution is required?

**Step 3: Rewrite**

* Remove subjective language
* Add technical precision
* Include sources/references
* Verify factual accuracy

**Example:**

```
Original: "Our revolutionary caching system dramatically improves performance."

Analysis:
- "revolutionary" = marketing language
- "dramatically" = subjective, unverified claim
- No specific metrics or comparison

Fixed: "Token caching reduces validation time by 85% (median) in benchmark tests. See benchmarks/results.md for detailed metrics."

Rationale:
- Removed marketing language
- Added specific, verifiable metric
- Provided reference to source data
- Maintained technical focus
```

== Common Patterns to Fix

=== Pattern 1: Feature Announcement

**Problematic:**

❌ "We're excited to announce our new validation API with amazing features!"

**Fixed:**

✅ "Version 2.0 introduces a new validation API with the following features: [list]"

=== Pattern 2: Ease-of-Use Claims

**Problematic:**

❌ "Integration is incredibly simple and takes just minutes."

**Fixed:**

✅ "Integration requires three steps: [numbered list with code examples]"

=== Pattern 3: Performance Bragging

**Problematic:**

❌ "Lightning-fast performance that outperforms all competitors."

**Fixed:**

✅ "Validation throughput: 50,000 tokens/second on reference hardware (see benchmarks/setup.md)"

=== Pattern 4: Vague Benefits

**Problematic:**

❌ "Provides better security and enhanced reliability."

**Fixed:**

✅ "Implements security requirements from RFC 7519 sections 4-6. Includes validation of: signature, expiration, issuer, audience."

== Integration with Review Process

When performing documentation reviews, apply these standards through:

1. **Systematic Analysis**
   - Read each section critically
   - Flag subjective language
   - Note unverified claims
   - Identify marketing patterns

2. **ULTRATHINK Reasoning** (for automated reviews)
   - Engage deeper analysis for tone issues
   - Consider context and intent
   - Evaluate alternatives
   - Justify recommended changes

3. **Prioritization**
   - Critical: Unverified claims, marketing language
   - High: Subjective descriptions, unclear statements
   - Medium: Minor tone inconsistencies
   - Low: Style preferences

4. **Verification**
   - After fixes, re-read for tone
   - Ensure technical accuracy preserved
   - Check that information is complete
   - Verify sources are attributed
