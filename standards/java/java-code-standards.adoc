== Overview

This document contains the comprehensive Java standards for all CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for Java development requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes. They ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality Java code across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The Java standards are organized into the following documents:

* xref:java-code-standards.adoc[Java Code Standards] - Standards for writing Java code (this document)
* xref:dsl-style-constants.adoc[DSL-Style Constants Pattern] - Standards for organizing constants in a hierarchical manner

== Key Principles

1. *Consistency*: All Java code follows the same patterns and conventions
2. *Maintainability*: Code is organized for long-term maintenance
3. *Readability*: Code is easy to read and understand
4. *Testability*: Code is designed to be easily testable

== Purpose

This document defines general best practices and standards for writing Java code in CUI projects. These standards ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality code across all Java projects.

== General Principles


. *Code Readability*: Write code that is easy to read and understand
. *Maintainability*: Design code that is easy to modify and extend
. *Consistency*: Follow consistent patterns across the codebase
. *Testability*: Write code that is easy to test
. *Performance*: Consider performance implications in design decisions

== Code Organization

=== Package Structure


. Use reverse domain name notation for package names
. Organize packages by feature rather than layer
. Keep package cohesion high

=== Class Structure


. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
. Keep classes small and focused
. Use proper access modifiers (public, protected, private)

=== Method Design


. Keep methods short and focused
. Use meaningful method names
. Follow the Command-Query Separation principle

== Coding Practices

=== Naming Conventions


. Use meaningful and descriptive names
. Follow standard Java naming conventions
. Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood

=== Exception Handling


. Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions
. Use unchecked exceptions for programming errors
. Don't catch generic Exception
. Include meaningful error messages

=== Documentation


. Follow Javadoc standards (see xref:../documentation/javadoc-standards.adoc[Javadoc Standards])

== Best Practices


. Prefer immutable objects
. Use final fields where appropriate
. Consider using records for data carriers
. Use interface types for declarations
. Prefer immutable collections
. Use appropriate collection types for use cases
. Use streams for complex data transformations
. Keep lambda expressions short and clear
. Avoid side effects in streams
. Prefer switch expressions over classic switch statements
. Always use the most recent features from the version to compile against (e.g., usage of Record-classes for Java 17)
. Use Lombok where sensible
. Prefer delegation over inheritance.
. Prefer Imports over fully qualified class names. Where applicable

=== Using Lombok

Use Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate code:

. `@Delegate` for delegation over inheritance
. `@Builder` for building complex objects  
. `@Value` for immutable objects

== Modern Java Features

=== Records for Data Carriers
[source,java]
----
public record User(String id, String name, String email) {}
----

=== Switch Expressions
[source,java]
----
String dayType(DayOfWeek day) {
    return switch (day) {
        case MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY -> "Weekday";
        case SATURDAY, SUNDAY -> "Weekend";
    };
}
----

=== Stream Processing
[source,java]
----
List<String> names = users.stream()
    .filter(user -> user.getAge() > 18)
    .map(User::getName)
    .sorted()
    .toList();
----
