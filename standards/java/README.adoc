== Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive Java standards and guidelines for all CUI projects. These standards ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality Java code across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The Java standards are organized into the following documents:

* `coding-standards.adoc` - Core Java coding standards and best practices
* `package-structure.adoc` - Standards for package organization and naming
* `naming-conventions.adoc` - Naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables
* `error-handling.adoc` - Standards for exception handling and error reporting
* xref:dsl-style-constants.adoc[DSL-Style Constants Pattern] - Pattern for organizing related constants in a hierarchical manner

== Key Principles

1. *Consistency*: All Java code follows the same patterns and conventions
2. *Maintainability*: Code is organized for long-term maintenance
3. *Readability*: Code is easy to read and understand
4. *Testability*: Code is designed to be easily testable
