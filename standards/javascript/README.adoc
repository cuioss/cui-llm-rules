== Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive JavaScript standards for all CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for JavaScript development requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes. They ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality JavaScript code across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The JavaScript standards are organized into the following documents:

* xref:project-structure.adoc[Project Structure] - Standards for directory structure, file organization, and package.json configuration
* xref:javascript-development-standards.adoc[JavaScript Development Standards] - JavaScript-specific configuration, dependencies, and Jest setup
* xref:maven-integration-standards.adoc[Maven Integration Standards] - Frontend-maven-plugin configuration and build integration
* xref:linting-standards.adoc[Linting Standards] - ESLint rules, configuration, and integration (updated for ESLint v9)
* xref:dependency-management-standards.adoc[Dependency Management Standards] - npm package management, security, and version control
* xref:unit-testing-standards.adoc[Unit Testing Standards] - Jest framework, configuration, and integration
* xref:formatting-standards.adoc[Formatting Standards] - Prettier rules, configuration, and integration
* xref:jsdoc-standards.adoc[JSDoc Documentation Standards] - Comprehensive documentation standards using JSDoc
* xref:javascript-best-practices.adoc[JavaScript Best Practices] - Modern JavaScript patterns and conventions
* xref:lit-components-standards.adoc[Lit Components Standards] - Rules and best practices for Lit web components (Quarkus DevUI context)

== Key Principles

1. *Modern JavaScript*: Use ES2022+ features and modern syntax patterns
2. *No TypeScript*: JavaScript-only development with JSDoc for type documentation
3. *Security First*: Comprehensive security vulnerability detection and prevention
4. *Dependency Management*: Proactive npm package management with automated security scanning
5. *Testing*: Comprehensive Jest-based testing with realistic coverage requirements
6. *Quality*: Advanced code quality analysis with complexity and maintainability metrics
7. *Performance*: Optimal bundling and modern architecture patterns
8. *Framework Agnostic*: Standards apply to vanilla JavaScript and framework-specific contexts

== Target Ecosystem

These standards are designed for:

* **Build System**: Maven with frontend-maven-plugin integration
* **Testing Framework**: Jest with jsdom environment
* **Linting**: ESLint v9 with flat configuration and comprehensive rule sets
* **Formatting**: Prettier with project-specific configuration
* **Package Management**: npm with automated vulnerability scanning and dependency management
* **Security**: Continuous security monitoring with automated vulnerability resolution
* **Framework Support**: Vanilla JavaScript with optional framework-specific extensions (e.g., Lit for Quarkus DevUI)
