== Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive JavaScript standards for all CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for JavaScript development requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes. They ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality JavaScript code across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The JavaScript standards are organized into the following documents:

* xref:project-structure.adoc[Project Structure] - Standards for directory structure, file organization, and package.json configuration
* xref:javascript-development-standards.adoc[JavaScript Development Standards] - JavaScript-specific configuration, dependencies, and Jest setup
* xref:maven-integration-standards.adoc[Maven Integration Standards] - Frontend-maven-plugin configuration and build integration
* xref:linting-standards.adoc[Linting Standards] - ESLint rules, configuration, and integration (updated for ESLint v9 + Cypress)
* xref:dependency-management-standards.adoc[Dependency Management Standards] - npm package management, security, and version control
* xref:unit-testing-standards.adoc[Unit Testing Standards] - Jest framework, configuration, and integration
* xref:cypress-e2e-testing-standards.adoc[Cypress E2E Testing Standards] - Framework-specific standards for Cypress end-to-end testing (updated with zero-warning implementation)
* xref:formatting-standards.adoc[Formatting Standards] - Prettier rules, configuration, and integration
* xref:jsdoc-standards.adoc[JSDoc Documentation Standards] - Comprehensive documentation standards using JSDoc
* xref:javascript-best-practices.adoc[JavaScript Best Practices] - Modern JavaScript patterns and conventions
* xref:lit-components-standards.adoc[Lit Components Standards] - Rules and best practices for Lit web components (Quarkus DevUI context)

== Key Achievements

=== Zero-Warning ESLint Implementation
The standards include a proven ESLint configuration that achieved:
* **98 warnings â†’ 0 warnings** through strategic rule configuration
* **Zero Prettier formatting errors** through consistent formatting standards  
* **Clean Maven builds** with integrated linting validation
* **Maintainable codebase** with comprehensive constants-based duplicate string elimination

=== Framework-Specific Optimizations
* **Cypress E2E Testing**: Complete configuration achieving zero warnings while supporting Cypress testing patterns
* **Console Error Management**: Automated tracking and validation of browser console output
* **Security-First Approach**: Comprehensive vulnerability detection with practical testing accommodations

== Key Principles

1. *Modern JavaScript*: Use ES2022+ features and modern syntax patterns
2. *No TypeScript*: JavaScript-only development with JSDoc for type documentation
3. *Security First*: Comprehensive security vulnerability detection and prevention
4. *Dependency Management*: Proactive npm package management with automated security scanning
5. *Testing*: Comprehensive Jest-based testing with realistic coverage requirements
6. *Quality*: Advanced code quality analysis with complexity and maintainability metrics
7. *Performance*: Optimal bundling and modern architecture patterns
8. *Framework Agnostic*: Standards apply to vanilla JavaScript and framework-specific contexts

== Target Ecosystem

These standards are designed for:

* **Build System**: Maven with frontend-maven-plugin integration
* **Testing Framework**: Jest with jsdom environment
* **Linting**: ESLint v9 with flat configuration and comprehensive rule sets
* **Formatting**: Prettier with project-specific configuration
* **Package Management**: npm with automated vulnerability scanning and dependency management
* **Security**: Continuous security monitoring with automated vulnerability resolution
* **Framework Support**: Vanilla JavaScript with optional framework-specific extensions (e.g., Lit for Quarkus DevUI)
