== Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive testing standards and guidelines for all CUI projects. These standards ensure consistent, thorough, and maintainable testing across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The testing standards are organized into the following documents:

* xref:core-standards.adoc[Core Standards] - Fundamental testing requirements and best practices
* xref:logging-testing.adoc[Logging Testing] - Specific guidance for testing logging implementations
* `unit-testing.adoc` - Standards for unit testing
* `integration-testing.adoc` - Standards for integration testing

== Key Principles

1. *Comprehensive Coverage*: All code should have appropriate test coverage
2. *Maintainability*: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
3. *Reliability*: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky
4. *Efficiency*: Tests should run quickly and use resources efficiently
