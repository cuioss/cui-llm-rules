== Getting Started

=== For New Developers
1. Start with **link:core-standards.adoc[Core Testing Standards]** to understand fundamental principles
2. Review **link:quality-standards.adoc[Quality Standards]** for coverage and quality requirements
3. Check **link:cui-test-generator-guide.adoc[CUI Test Generator Guide]** for test data generation patterns

=== For Project Setup
1. Follow **link:integration-testing.adoc[Integration Testing Standards]** for Maven configuration
2. Implement quality gates from **link:quality-standards.adoc[Quality Standards]**
3. Set up test frameworks according to **link:core-standards.adoc[Core Testing Standards]**

=== For Specific Use Cases

== Key Testing Principles

These principles are consistent across all testing standards:

=== 🎯 **Comprehensive Coverage**
All code should have appropriate test coverage based on risk and complexity

=== 🔧 **Maintainability** 
Tests should be easy to understand, modify, and maintain over time

=== 🚀 **Reliability**
Tests must be deterministic and not produce false positives or negatives

=== ⚡ **Efficiency**
Tests should run quickly and use resources efficiently

=== 🏗️ **Separation of Concerns**
Clear distinction between unit tests, integration tests, and other test types

== CUI Testing Framework

The standards require the following CUI-approved technologies:

=== **Required Frameworks**
* **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)** - Primary testing framework
* **cui-test-generator** - Mandatory for all test data generation
* **cui-test-value-objects** - Required for value object contract testing

=== **Allowed Libraries**
* **awaitility** - For asynchronous testing and waiting conditions
* **rest-assured** - For REST API testing and validation

=== **Forbidden Libraries**
* **Mockito** - Use CUI framework alternatives instead
* **PowerMock** - Use dependency injection patterns instead
* **Hamcrest** - Use JUnit 5 assertions exclusively

=== **Build Integration**
* **Maven Surefire Plugin** - Unit test execution
* **Maven Failsafe Plugin** - Integration test execution
* **Coverage Profile** - Use `-Pcoverage` for coverage verification

== Compliance and Updates

=== Document Versioning
These standards are living documents that evolve with the projects. Check the git history for the most recent updates and changes.

=== Compliance Requirements
All CUI projects must adhere to these testing standards. Deviations should be documented and approved through the standard change process.

=== Feedback and Improvements
Suggestions for improvements to these standards should be submitted through the project's standard feedback channels.
