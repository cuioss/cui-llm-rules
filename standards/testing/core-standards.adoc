== Overview

This document contains the comprehensive testing standards for all CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for testing requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes. They ensure consistent, thorough, and maintainable testing across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The testing standards are organized into the following documents:

* xref:core-standards.adoc[Core Standards] - Fundamental testing standards and requirements (this document)
* xref:quality-standards.adoc[Quality Standards] - Standards for test quality and coverage
* xref:../cdi-quarkus/testing-standards.adoc[Quarkus Testing Standards] - Testing standards for Quarkus applications
* xref:../logging/testing-guide.adoc[Logging Testing Guide] - Standards for testing logging implementations

== Key Principles

1. *Comprehensive Coverage*: All code should have appropriate test coverage
2. *Maintainability*: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
3. *Reliability*: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky
4. *Efficiency*: Tests should run quickly and use resources efficiently

== Purpose

This document defines the core standards and best practices for writing and maintaining tests across all CUI projects.

== Core Testing Principles

=== Test Coverage

* All public methods must have unit tests
* All business logic must have appropriate test coverage
* Edge cases and error conditions must be tested
* Test coverage should aim for at least 80% line coverage

=== Test Independence

* Tests must be independent and not rely on other tests
* Tests must not depend on execution order
* Tests must clean up after themselves
* Tests must not have side effects that affect other tests

=== Test Clarity

* Test names must clearly describe what is being tested
* Test methods should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
* Each test should test one specific behavior
* Comments should explain complex test setups or assertions

=== Test Maintenance

* Tests must be maintained alongside production code
* Failing tests must be fixed promptly
* Tests should be refactored when production code changes
* Test code should follow the same quality standards as production code

== Test Types

=== Unit Tests

* Focus on testing a single unit of code in isolation
* Mock or stub dependencies
* Should be fast and lightweight
* Should cover all code paths

=== Integration Tests

* Test interaction between components
* May use real dependencies or test doubles
* Should verify correct integration behavior
* Should be isolated from external systems when possible

=== System Tests

* Test the entire system as a whole
* Verify end-to-end functionality
* May involve multiple components and services
* Should simulate real-world usage

== Test Code Guidelines

=== Scope of Changes

* Make targeted changes with single, clear purpose
* Avoid unrelated refactoring or improvements
* Focus on specific test requirements
* Document purpose of test changes

== Best Practices

=== Test Organization

* Group related tests in the same test class
* Use descriptive test method names
* Follow a consistent naming convention
* Organize tests in a logical order

=== Test Data

* Use meaningful test data
* Avoid hardcoded values
* Consider edge cases
* Use test data builders when appropriate

=== Assertions

* Use specific assertions
* Include meaningful error messages
* Verify only what is necessary
* Use assertion libraries appropriately

== Important Notes

* All rules are normative and must be applied unconditionally
* Test code should be treated with the same care as production code
* Tests should be maintainable and readable
* Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
