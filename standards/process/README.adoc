== Purpose

This directory contains process documentation that defines WHEN and WHAT to do for various development and maintenance activities. Process standards focus on workflow, sequencing, and decision-making rather than technical implementation details.

== Process vs. Standards

Process documents in this directory complement the technical standards found elsewhere in the standards ecosystem:

* **Process Documents** (this directory): Define workflows, timing, and decision processes
* **Technical Standards** (other directories): Define implementation requirements and quality criteria
* **Cross-References**: Process documents reference technical standards for detailed "HOW" guidance

== Process Documentation

=== Development Workflow

**NOTE**: Process standards are being migrated to the marketplace architecture (claude/marketplace/bundles).
Many processes have been migrated to commands in cui-java-expert, cui-requirements, and other bundles.
Remaining files will be migrated to appropriate bundles.

==== xref:git-commit-standards.adoc[Git Commit Standards]
Standardized approach for git commit messages across all projects following conventional commit format. Ensures consistent, traceable commit history that supports automated tooling and code review processes.

**Key Features:**
* Conventional commit message format
* Type and scope guidelines
* Examples for various scenarios including task-based commits
* Breaking change documentation patterns

=== Code Maintenance Processes

**Key Features:**
* Systematic refactoring workflow
* Quality verification at each step
* Risk management and rollback procedures
* Integration with task completion standards

==== xref:quarkus-native-optimization.adoc[Quarkus Native Optimization Process]
Systematic process for optimizing Quarkus applications for native image compilation, focusing on reflection registration optimization and performance improvements. Provides structured workflow for identifying, implementing, and verifying native optimization opportunities.

**Key Features:**
* Reflection usage analysis and optimization strategies
* Deployment processor and application-level optimization techniques
* Native image compatibility testing procedures
* Performance metrics tracking and verification
* Integration with CDI framework requirements

==== Java Code Maintenance Process [MIGRATED]
**MIGRATED** to marketplace: `/cui-java-refactor` command in cui-java-expert bundle.
Process for maintaining and refactoring Java production code to enforce all aspects of Java Code Standards.

==== Java Test Maintenance Process [MIGRATED]
**MIGRATED** to marketplace: `/cui-test-maintain` command in cui-java-expert bundle.
Process for maintaining and improving Java test quality while preserving functionality and adhering to CUI testing standards.

==== xref:javascript-code-maintenance.adoc[JavaScript Code Maintenance Process]
Process for maintaining and refactoring JavaScript production code to enforce all aspects of JavaScript Development Standards. Focuses on vanilla JavaScript preference, proper modularization, and package.json management.

**Key Features:**
* Vanilla JavaScript usage enforcement
* Test/mock code separation from production
* Modularization and duplication management
* Package.json and dependency maintenance
* JSDoc and comment quality standards

==== xref:javascript-test-maintenance.adoc[JavaScript Test Maintenance Process]
Process for maintaining and improving JavaScript test quality while preserving functionality and adhering to modern JavaScript testing standards. Provides systematic approaches for Jest and Cypress test improvements.

**Key Features:**
* JavaScript test anti-pattern detection
* Mock and stub management best practices
* Async test pattern improvements
* Testing Library query optimization
* E2E test maintenance with Cypress

==== xref:pom-maintenance.adoc[POM Maintenance Process]
Process for maintaining and optimizing Maven POM files across Java projects. Provides systematic approaches for dependency management, BOM utilization, version optimization, and POM quality improvements while adhering to Maven best practices.

**Key Features:**
* OpenRewrite integration for automated cleanup
* BOM management and centralized version control
* Dependency scope optimization and verification
* Multi-module dependency aggregation strategies
* Maven wrapper maintenance procedures

==== Logger Maintenance Process [MIGRATED]
**MIGRATED** to marketplace: `/cui-logger-maintain` command in cui-java-expert bundle.
Process for implementing and maintaining logging standards compliance while preserving functionality.

=== Documentation Maintenance

==== Javadoc Maintenance Process [MIGRATED]
**MIGRATED** to marketplace: `/cui-javadoc-fix` command in cui-java-expert bundle.
Process for Javadoc error resolution and quality assurance.

==== Requirements Maintenance Process [MIGRATED]
**MIGRATED** to marketplace: `/cui-requirements-maintain` command in cui-requirements bundle.
Process for maintaining requirements and specification documents to ensure continued accuracy, traceability, and alignment with implementation.

== Common Process Patterns

All process documents in this directory follow consistent patterns:

=== Structure
* **Pre-Maintenance Checklist**: Required verification before starting
* **Module-by-Module Approach**: Systematic processing strategy
* **Critical Constraints**: Protection of production code and behavior
* **Workflow Phases**: Analysis → Implementation → Verification
* **Success Criteria**: Clear completion requirements

=== Integration Points
* **Git Commit Standards**: Referenced for proper commit message formatting
* **Technical Standards**: Cross-referenced for implementation details
* **Quality Gates**: Maven commands and verification steps (integrated into marketplace commands)
* **Marketplace Commands**: Process orchestration via cui-java-expert, cui-maven, cui-requirements bundles

=== Quality Assurance
* Build verification before and after changes
* Test execution requirements
* Coverage preservation
* Documentation synchronization
* Incremental commit strategies

== Usage Guidelines

=== When to Use Process Documents
* Planning systematic code improvements
* Onboarding team members to development workflows
* Establishing consistent practices across projects
* Ensuring quality gates are properly implemented
* Coordinating multi-module changes

=== Process Selection
* **General Development**: Use marketplace commands (cui-java-expert, cui-maven bundles)
* **Code Refactoring**: Use `/cui-java-refactor` command (migrated to marketplace)
* **Quarkus Native Optimization**: Follow xref:quarkus-native-optimization.adoc[Quarkus Native Optimization Process]
* **Java Code Improvements**: Use `/cui-java-refactor` command (cui-java-expert bundle)
* **Java Test Improvements**: Use `/cui-test-maintain` command (cui-java-expert bundle)
* **JavaScript Code Improvements**: Follow xref:javascript-code-maintenance.adoc[JavaScript Code Maintenance Process]
* **JavaScript Test Improvements**: Follow xref:javascript-test-maintenance.adoc[JavaScript Test Maintenance Process]
* **Maven POM Maintenance**: Apply xref:pom-maintenance.adoc[POM Maintenance Process]
* **Logging Updates**: Use `/cui-logger-maintain` command (cui-java-expert bundle)
* **Documentation Fixes**: Use `/cui-javadoc-fix` command (cui-java-expert bundle)
* **Requirements Updates**: Use `/cui-requirements-maintain` command (cui-requirements bundle)

=== Cross-Process Coordination
When working across multiple areas:
1. Use marketplace commands for orchestrated workflows (cui-java-expert, cui-maven bundles)
2. Apply specific maintenance processes for targeted improvements
3. Use git commit standards for all commits
4. Reference technical standards for implementation details
5. Verify quality gates throughout the process (integrated into marketplace commands)

== Integration with Technical Standards

Process documents reference technical standards for implementation guidance:

* **Testing Standards**: xref:../testing/quality-standards.adoc[Quality Standards], xref:../testing/cui-test-generator-guide.adoc[CUI Test Generator Guide]
* **Logging Standards**: xref:../logging/core-standards.adoc[Core Standards], xref:../logging/implementation-guide.adoc[Implementation Guide]
* **Java Standards**: xref:../java/java-code-standards.adoc[Java Code Standards]
* **JavaScript Standards**: xref:../javascript/javascript-development-standards.adoc[JavaScript Development Standards], xref:../javascript/javascript-core-patterns.adoc[Core Patterns]
* **Documentation Standards**: xref:../documentation/javadoc-standards.adoc[Javadoc Standards], xref:../javascript/jsdoc-standards.adoc[JSDoc Standards]
