== Purpose

This directory contains process documentation that defines WHEN and WHAT to do for various development and maintenance activities. Process standards focus on workflow, sequencing, and decision-making rather than technical implementation details.

== Process vs. Standards

Process documents in this directory complement the technical standards found elsewhere in the standards ecosystem:

* **Process Documents** (this directory): Define workflows, timing, and decision processes
* **Technical Standards** (other directories): Define implementation requirements and quality criteria
* **Cross-References**: Process documents reference technical standards for detailed "HOW" guidance

== Process Documentation

=== Development Workflow

==== xref:task-completion-standards.adoc[Task Completion Standards]
Standardized quality verification process for all CUI LLM project development tasks. Defines the mandatory pre-commit checklist, Maven profile requirements, and quality gates that must be met before any code is committed.

**Key Features:**
* Pre-commit checklist with concrete Maven commands
* Quality verification requirements
* Documentation and commit message standards
* Task management guidelines

==== xref:git-commit-standards.adoc[Git Commit Standards]
Standardized approach for git commit messages across all projects following conventional commit format. Ensures consistent, traceable commit history that supports automated tooling and code review processes.

**Key Features:**
* Conventional commit message format
* Type and scope guidelines
* Examples for various scenarios including task-based commits
* Breaking change documentation patterns

=== Code Maintenance Processes

==== xref:refactoring-process.adoc[Refactoring Process]
Process for systematic code refactoring and improvement activities. Provides structured approach to planning, executing, and verifying refactoring work while maintaining code quality and functionality.

**Key Features:**
* Systematic refactoring workflow
* Quality verification at each step
* Risk management and rollback procedures
* Integration with task completion standards

==== xref:java-test-maintenance.adoc[Java Test Maintenance Process]
Process for maintaining and improving Java test quality while preserving functionality and adhering to CUI testing standards. Focuses on module-by-module approach with emphasis on CUI framework compliance.

**Key Features:**
* Module-by-module processing strategy
* CUI framework compliance requirements
* Test quality issue detection and resolution
* AI-generated code cleanup patterns
* SonarQube compliance guidance

==== xref:logger-maintenance.adoc[Logger Maintenance Process]
Process for implementing and maintaining logging standards compliance while preserving functionality. Provides systematic approach to migrating to CuiLogger and implementing proper LogRecord usage patterns.

**Key Features:**
* CuiLogger migration workflow
* LogRecord implementation requirements
* LogMessages structure compliance
* Testing implementation for logging code
* Documentation synchronization

=== Documentation Maintenance

==== xref:javadoc-maintenance.adoc[Javadoc Maintenance Process]
Process for Javadoc error resolution and quality assurance. Provides systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and resolving Javadoc issues while maintaining documentation quality.

**Key Features:**
* Javadoc error detection and categorization
* Systematic resolution workflow
* Quality verification procedures
* Integration with build processes

== Common Process Patterns

All process documents in this directory follow consistent patterns:

=== Structure
* **Pre-Maintenance Checklist**: Required verification before starting
* **Module-by-Module Approach**: Systematic processing strategy
* **Critical Constraints**: Protection of production code and behavior
* **Workflow Phases**: Analysis → Implementation → Verification
* **Success Criteria**: Clear completion requirements

=== Integration Points
* **Task Completion Standards**: Referenced by all processes for quality verification
* **Git Commit Standards**: Referenced for proper commit message formatting
* **Technical Standards**: Cross-referenced for implementation details
* **Quality Gates**: Consistent Maven commands and verification steps

=== Quality Assurance
* Build verification before and after changes
* Test execution requirements
* Coverage preservation
* Documentation synchronization
* Incremental commit strategies

== Usage Guidelines

=== When to Use Process Documents
* Planning systematic code improvements
* Onboarding team members to development workflows
* Establishing consistent practices across projects
* Ensuring quality gates are properly implemented
* Coordinating multi-module changes

=== Process Selection
* **General Development**: Start with xref:task-completion-standards.adoc[Task Completion Standards]
* **Code Refactoring**: Use xref:refactoring-process.adoc[Refactoring Process]
* **Test Improvements**: Follow xref:java-test-maintenance.adoc[Java Test Maintenance Process]
* **Logging Updates**: Apply xref:logger-maintenance.adoc[Logger Maintenance Process]
* **Documentation Fixes**: Use xref:javadoc-maintenance.adoc[Javadoc Maintenance Process]

=== Cross-Process Coordination
When working across multiple areas:
1. Always start with task completion standards for baseline requirements
2. Apply specific maintenance processes for targeted improvements
3. Use git commit standards for all commits
4. Reference technical standards for implementation details
5. Verify quality gates throughout the process

== Integration with Technical Standards

Process documents reference technical standards for implementation guidance:

* **Testing Standards**: xref:../testing/quality-standards.adoc[Quality Standards], xref:../testing/cui-test-generator-guide.adoc[CUI Test Generator Guide]
* **Logging Standards**: xref:../logging/core-standards.adoc[Core Standards], xref:../logging/implementation-guide.adoc[Implementation Guide]
* **Java Standards**: xref:../java/java-code-standards.adoc[Java Code Standards]
* **Documentation Standards**: xref:../documentation/javadoc-standards.adoc[Javadoc Standards]
