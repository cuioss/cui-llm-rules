Standardized quality verification process for all CUI LLM project development tasks.

== Pre-Commit Checklist (Mandatory)

Execute in sequence before any commit:

1. [ ] *Quality Verification*: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -DskipTests`
   - Fix all errors and warnings (mandatory)
   - Address code quality, formatting, and linting issues

2. [ ] *Final Verification*: `./mvnw clean install`
   - Must complete without errors or warnings
   - All tests must pass
   - Tasks are complete only after this succeeds

3. [ ] *Documentation*: Update if changes affect APIs, features, or configuration

4. [ ] *Commit Message*: Follow <<git-commit-standards.adoc#,Git Commit Standards>>

5. [ ] *Task Status*: Update project management tools (if applicable)

== Maven Profile Requirements

Projects must include a `pre-commit` profile for quality checks without test execution:
* Code formatting validation
* Linting and static analysis  
* Documentation generation
* Security and dependency scanning

== Development Guidelines

=== Quality Requirements
* New code requires appropriate test coverage
* Existing tests must continue to pass
* Documentation must be updated for API/feature changes

=== Task Management
* Link commits to relevant issues or tasks
* Mark tasks complete only after quality checks pass
* Use meaningful commit messages for code review

=== Refactoring
For structured refactoring work, follow <<refactoring-process.adoc#,Refactoring Process Documentation>>.
