== Purpose

Defines the systematic process for maintaining requirements and specification documents to ensure continued accuracy, traceability, and alignment with implementation.

== Critical Constraints

=== Documentation Principles

Adhere to key principles from xref:../documentation/general-standard.adoc#_key_principles[Documentation Standards]:


* **Consistency** - Uniform terminology and structure
* **Completeness** - All requirements fully documented
* **Clarity** - Unambiguous statements
* **Maintainability** - Easy to update and extend

=== Integrity Requirements


* **No Hallucinations** - Document only existing functionality
* **No Duplications** - Use cross-references, not copies
* **Verified Links** - All references must point to existing documents or code

== Pre-Maintenance Checklist


* [ ] Identify scope of maintenance (specific documents or full review)
* [ ] Verify access to all referenced specifications and requirements
* [ ] Review xref:../requirements/specification-and-implementation.adoc[distribution guidelines]
* [ ] Understand current document structure and dependencies

== Requirements Review Process

=== Analyze Current State

Review target requirements documents for:


* Missing or incomplete requirements
* Outdated references to deprecated functionality
* Broken cross-references
* Inconsistent terminology
* Duplicate information across documents

=== Update Requirements

Apply changes following xref:../requirements/requirements-document.adoc[Requirements Document Structure]:


* Update requirement statements for accuracy
* Maintain requirement IDs and traceability
* Preserve requirement rationale and constraints
* Update status indicators if present

=== Verify Specification Alignment

Ensure specifications match requirements per xref:../requirements/specification-and-implementation.adoc[Specification and Implementation]:


* Check specification links to requirements
* Verify implementation references are accurate
* Update cross-references between documents
* Maintain traceability matrix if present

== Specification Maintenance Process

=== Review Specifications

Examine specification documents for:


* Alignment with current requirements
* Accurate implementation references
* Complete behavioral descriptions
* Valid cross-references

=== Update Specifications

Follow xref:../requirements/specification-documents.adoc[Specification Documents Structure]:


* Maintain clear linkage to requirements
* Update implementation details as needed
* Preserve specification IDs
* Keep examples current and valid

== Cross-Reference Verification

=== Document Links

Verify all internal documentation links:


* Check `xref:` references resolve correctly
* Update paths after any restructuring
* Remove references to deleted documents
* Add references to new related documents

=== Code References

Validate implementation references:


* Verify referenced classes/methods exist
* Update package names if changed
* Confirm line numbers if specified
* Remove references to deleted code

== Common Maintenance Scenarios

=== New Feature Documentation

When documenting new features:


* Add requirements following established format
* Create specifications linked to requirements
* Update related documents with cross-references
* Maintain traceability throughout

=== Deprecation Handling

When functionality changes or is removed:


* **Pre-1.0 Projects**: Update requirements directly without deprecation process
* **Post-1.0 Projects**: Always ask user whether to deprecate or remove
* **If Deprecating**: Mark requirements as deprecated (do not delete)
* **If Deprecating**: Update specifications to reflect deprecated status
* **If Deprecating**: Add migration guidance if applicable
* **If Deprecating**: Maintain historical record

=== Refactoring Impact

After code refactoring:


* Update implementation references in specifications
* Verify requirement statements remain accurate
* Adjust examples to match new structure
* Maintain requirement IDs unchanged

== Quality Verification

Complete maintenance per xref:task-completion-standards.adoc[Task Completion Standards]:


* All cross-references validated
* No duplicate information remains
* Consistent terminology throughout
* Clear traceability maintained
* No hallucinated functionality documented

== Commit Guidelines

Follow xref:git-commit-standards.adoc[Git Commit Standards]:


* Use prefix: `docs(requirements):`
* Describe specific changes made
* Reference affected requirement/specification IDs
* Note any structural changes
