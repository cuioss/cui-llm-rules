== Core Rules

* If in doubt, ask the user.
* Always research topics. Use MCP tools like DuckDuckGo or GitHub whenever possible. The goal is to find the most recent best practices. Always aim for the latest best practices for a given technology or framework.
* Never guess or be creative. If you cannot find best practices for a topic, ask the user.
* Do not proliferate documents. Always use the context-relevant documents and never create a document without user approval.
* Never add a dependency without user approval. Always ask the user before adding a dependency.
