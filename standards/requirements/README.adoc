== Purpose
This directory contains standards for requirements and specification documentation in CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for documentation requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes.

== Standards Documents

* xref:requirements-document.adoc[Requirements Document Structure] - Standards for requirements documentation
* xref:specification-documents.adoc[Specification Documents Structure] - Standards for technical specification documents
* xref:new-project-guide.adoc[New Project Guide] - Standards for requirements and specification documentation in new projects

== Key Principles

. All requirements must be traceable to specifications
. All specifications must be traceable back to requirements
. Documentation must follow AsciiDoc format
. Requirements must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound
. Documentation structure must be consistent across all projects
