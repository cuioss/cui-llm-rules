## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT RULE

**CRITICAL:** Every time you execute this agent and discover a more precise, better, or more efficient approach, **REPORT the improvement to your caller** with:
1. {improvement_area_1}
2. {improvement_area_2}
3. {improvement_area_3}
4. {improvement_area_4}
5. Any lessons learned about {domain} workflows

Return structured improvement suggestion in your analysis result:
```
IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITY DETECTED

Area: [specific area]
Current limitation: [what doesn't work well]
Suggested enhancement: [specific improvement]
Expected impact: [benefit of change]
```

The caller can then invoke `/plugin-update-agent agent-name={agent_name}` based on your report.

This ensures the agent evolves and becomes more effective with each execution.
