= Cascade LLM Rules

This repository serves as the primary source of truth for Cascade's behavior and decision-making processes. It defines the standards, processes, and rules that Cascade follows when assisting with code maintenance and development.

== Core Principles

1. Code Quality
2. API Stability
3. Documentation Accuracy
4. Process Consistency

== Available Commands

[IMPORTANT]
====
All commands prefixed with `cp:` are AI assistant commands and must NEVER be executed in a shell. These commands are exclusively for communication with the AI assistant and are processed internally by the AI system.

|`[7] cp: verify sonar` *(AI Assistant Command)*
|Performs SonarCloud analysis:
- Reviews quality gates
- Examines code issues
- Verifies coverage metrics
See: link:maintenance/java/process.md[Java Process]

|`[8] cp: commit llm-rules to memory` *(AI Assistant Command)*
|Creates memories from documentation:
- One-time transfer from @llm-rules to AI memory
- Creates/updates AI assistant memories
- Ensures completeness
- Establishes memory source of truth
See: link:cascade/commands/memory/commit.md[Memory Creation]

|`[9] cp: persist memory to llm-rules` *(AI Assistant Command)*
|Persists memory content to documentation:
- Updates @llm-rules from AI memories
- Maintains documentation structure
- Ensures completeness
See: link:cascade/commands/memory/persist.md[Memory Persistence]

|`[10] cp: verify llm-rules` *(AI Assistant Command)*
|Verifies documentation against rules:
- Checks document structure and organization
- Validates cross-references and links
- Ensures documentation standards compliance
See: link:cascade/commands/verify/rules.md[Rules Verification]

|`[11] cp: update llm-rules` *(AI Assistant Command)*
|Interactively updates documentation:
- Consults latest documentation rules
- Creates or updates documentation
- Ensures complete understanding
- Maintains documentation standards
See: link:cascade/commands/update/rules.md[Rules Update]

== Command Verification

1. Command Documentation Requirements
   - Every command must have:
     * Entry in README.adoc command table
     * Dedicated documentation file
     * Complete implementation details
     * Clear success criteria

2. Command File Location
   - Cascade commands: link:cascade/commands/[category]/*.md[Command Documentation]
   - Maintenance commands: link:maintenance/*.md[Maintenance Documentation]
   - Core standards: link:core/standards/*.md[Core Standards]

3. Command Table Structure
   - Command name (exact format)
   - Purpose summary
   - Key features (3-5 bullet points)
   - Reference to documentation file

4. Verification Steps
   When adding/updating commands:
   a. Update README.adoc command table
   b. Create/update command documentation
   c. Cross-reference all files
   d. Verify command list completeness

== Documentation Completeness

Each command and process must maintain complete documentation following these rules:

1. Structure Requirements
   - Clear purpose statement
   - Detailed process steps
   - Error handling procedures
   - Success criteria
   - Integration points (if applicable)
   - Command-specific constraints

2. Content Requirements
   - No information loss from previous versions
   - All sections fully documented
   - Clear step-by-step procedures
   - Error scenarios covered
   - Examples where needed

3. Verification Process
   - Regular completeness checks
   - Cross-reference validation
   - Version tracking
   - Change documentation

See: link:cascade/commands/verify/rules.md[Rules Verification Process]

== Rule Application

1. Cascade always checks these rules before taking action
2. Rules are applied in order of specificity
3. Standards must be followed without exception
4. Core principles must always be maintained
5. Documentation completeness must be verified

== Version Control

1. Documentation Changes
   - Track all modifications
   - Maintain change history
   - Document verification results
   - Note any exceptions

2. Verification Requirements
   - Regular completeness checks
   - Cross-reference validation
   - Version tracking
   - Change documentation

== Contributing

When adding new rules:

1. Follow existing structure
2. Update README.adoc
3. Maintain consistency
4. Include clear examples
5. Document rationale
