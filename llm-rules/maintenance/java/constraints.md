## API Stability Constraints

### Core Requirements
- Must preserve existing public API
- No changes to method signatures
- No changes to class hierarchies
- No changes to package structure
- No removal or modification of public methods
- No changes to method return types or parameters

### Change Management
1. Production Code Changes
   - Strictly prohibited without explicit user confirmation
   - Must provide detailed reasoning including:
     * Clear problem statement
     * Impact analysis
     * Potential risks
     * Alternative solutions considered
   - Only proceed after receiving explicit user approval

2. Backward Compatibility
   - All changes must maintain backward compatibility
   - No breaking changes to public APIs
   - Migration paths required for any deprecations
   - Documentation must reflect all changes

## Dependency Management

### Core Requirements
- No new dependencies may be added
- This constraint takes precedence over CUI standards
- Must work within existing dependency set
- Cannot add CUI dependencies if not already present

### Dependency Updates
1. Allowed Updates:
   - Security patches only
   - Required fixes for deprecated APIs
   - Critical bug fixes

2. Prohibited Updates:
   - Version upgrades for features
   - New dependency additions
   - Optional improvements

## Code Modification Rules

### Test Code Changes
1. Allowed Modifications:
   - JUnit 5 migration
   - Test organization improvements
   - Coverage enhancements
   - Documentation updates
   - Logging assertion updates

2. Requirements:
   - No production code changes
   - All tests must pass
   - No regression in coverage
   - Clear documentation of changes

### Production Code Changes
1. Allowed Modifications:
   - Logging standard updates
   - Deprecated API fixes
   - Security patches
   - Critical bug fixes

2. Requirements:
   - Explicit approval needed
   - Full impact assessment
   - Risk evaluation
   - Backward compatibility
   - Migration documentation

## Success Criteria

### API Stability
- All public APIs preserved
- No breaking changes
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Migration paths documented

### Dependency Management
- No new dependencies added
- Existing dependencies maintained
- Security requirements met
- All updates documented

### Code Quality
- All tests passing
- Coverage maintained
- Documentation complete
- No critical issues
