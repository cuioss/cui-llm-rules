## Core Testing Standards

### 1. Test Structure and Organization
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- One logical assertion per test
- Clear test naming convention
- Descriptive test documentation
- Independent test execution
- Clean test environment
- Predictable test data

### 2. Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% line coverage
- Critical paths must have 100% coverage
- All public APIs must be tested
- Edge cases must be covered
- No coverage regressions allowed
- Regular coverage review

### 3. Testing Tools and Frameworks

#### Required Frameworks
1. JUnit 5
   - Use `@DisplayName` for readable test names
   - Leverage parameterized tests
   - Apply proper test lifecycle annotations

#### CUI Testing Utilities
1. cui-test-generator
   - Use for generating test data
   - Follow builder patterns
   - Document generator configurations

2. cui-test-value-objects
   - Leverage for value object testing
   - Follow equality testing guidelines
   - Include serialization tests

3. cui-jsf-test-basic
   - Use for JSF component testing
   - Follow component test patterns
   - Include lifecycle tests

### 4. Test Categories

#### Unit Tests
- Test single units in isolation
- Mock all dependencies
- Fast execution
- High maintainability

#### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Minimal mocking
- Cover critical paths
- Include error scenarios
- Regular maintenance required

#### System Tests
- End-to-end scenarios
- Real dependencies where possible
- Cover main user flows
- Include performance criteria

## Quality Verification

### 1. Quality Analysis Tools
- SonarCloud for static code analysis (see [SonarCloud Integration](../../maintenance/sonar.md))
- JUnit for unit testing
- Mutation testing for test quality
- Regular code reviews
- Continuous integration checks

### 2. Quality Metrics
- Code coverage
- Code duplication
- Complexity metrics
- Issue density
- Technical debt ratio

### 3. Best Practices

#### Test Quality
- Regular test review
- Mutation testing
- Test failure analysis
- DRY in test utilities
- Clear test documentation
- Consistent patterns

#### Performance
- Fast test execution
- Efficient resource usage
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Regular performance monitoring

#### Review Process
Regular Review Points:
- After major feature completion
- Before creating pull requests
- During code review process
- Post-merge verification

#### Documentation
- Record quality findings
- Document remediation steps
- Note technical debt decisions
- Update quality metrics
- Track coverage changes

## Success Criteria

### 1. Test Coverage
- All coverage requirements met
- Critical paths fully covered
- Test quality sufficient
- No coverage regressions

### 2. Quality Analysis
- All quality gates passed
- New issues addressed
- Impact assessed
- Clear remediation paths
- Documentation complete

### 3. Security
- No critical vulnerabilities
- Security hotspots reviewed
- Dependencies verified
- Security standards met
